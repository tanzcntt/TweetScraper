          "alt": "In this week’s episode, CoinDesk’s Christine Kim and Consensys’ Ben Edgington discuss the significance of three events: an Ethereum 2.0 milestone, an Ethereum hard fork upgrade and the public listing of a major cryptocurrency exchange. \n\nThis episode is sponsored by hellointerpop.io, The Sun Exchange.\n\nBeginning with Coinbase’s direct listing on Nasdaq, Kim and Edgington consider whether this watershed moment in the cryptocurrency industry is really something to get excited about. \n\n“Bitcoin was created to be this peer-to-peer payments network, where you don’t need any financial middlemen; but here’s Coinbase. Everyone is getting so excited and happy [about] Coinbase even though it’s doing the very thing that Bitcoin was created to deal with and get rid of,” Kim said. \n\nConcerns over centralized actors overshadowing the decentralized purpose of blockchains is also relevant to Ethereum. Ethereum infrastructure provider Infura is an example of a company who has faced criticism in the past for their expanding role as the “gatekeeper” to Ethereum. \n\n“It’s an interesting spectrum and we’ve only just begun on this journey,” said Edgington. “Only a few million people have interacted with the blockchain, any blockchain, so far, and there are a few billion yet to reach. I think we need to make it as easy as possible from them to do so.” \n\nKim and Edgington also discussed the milestone of the Ethereum proof-of-stake network, also called Ethereum 2.0, reaching its one millionth slot. A slot on Eth 2.0 is space for a block containing transactions and user data to be processed and finalized. Every 12 seconds validators, which are the equivalent of miners, can propose a block into a slot and earn rewards. \n\n“It’s just a number, but it’s a good point to take stock of where we are. [Eth 2.0] has been running for four and a half months now and it’s been totally trouble free. It’s just been incredible,” said Edgington. \n\nFinally, the two dissect the post mortem of Ethereum’s latest backwards-incompatible system-wide upgrade known as the Berlin hard fork. Everything didn’t go as planned and, as Kim notes, it’ll become increasingly important that things do work as Ethereum releases more ambitious upgrades in future. \n\nCheck out the full podcast episode hosted by Edington and Kim to get all the latest commentary around Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0. \n\nLinks mentioned in this podcast: What’s New In Eth2 (www.eth2.news)   Valid Points (https://www.coindesk.com/newsletter/valid-points)   \n\n\nInterPop is redefining the future of NFTs and fandom.

Everyone is getting so excited and happy [about] Coinbase even though it’s doing the very thing that Bitcoin was created to deal with and get rid of,” Kim said. \n\nConcerns over centralized actors overshadowing the decentralized purpose of blockchains is also relevant to Ethereum. Ethereum infrastructure provider Infura is an example of a company who has faced criticism in the past for their expanding role as the “gatekeeper” to Ethereum. \n\n“It’s an interesting spectrum and we’ve only just begun on this journey,” said Edgington. “Only a few million people have interacted with the blockchain, any blockchain, so far, and there are a few billion yet to reach. I think we need to make it as easy as possible from them to do so.” \n\nKim and Edgington also discussed the milestone of the Ethereum proof-of-stake network, also called Ethereum 2.0, reaching its one millionth slot. A slot on Eth 2.0 is space for a block containing transactions and user data to be processed and finalized. Every 12 seconds validators, which are the equivalent of miners, can propose a block into a slot and earn rewards. \n\n“It’s just a number, but it’s a good point to take stock of where we are. [Eth 2.0] has been running for four and a half months now and it’s been totally trouble free. It’s just been incredible,” said Edgington. \n\nFinally, the two dissect the post mortem of Ethereum’s latest backwards-incompatible system-wide upgrade known as the Berlin hard fork. Everything didn’t go as planned and, as Kim notes, it’ll become increasingly important that things do work as Ethereum releases more ambitious upgrades in future. \n\nCheck out the full podcast episode hosted by Edington and Kim to get all the latest commentary around Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0. \n\nLinks mentioned in this podcast: What’s New In Eth2 (www.eth2.news)   Valid Points (https://www.coindesk.com/newsletter/valid-points)   \n\n\nInterPop is redefining the future of NFTs and fandom.

Everyone is getting so excited and happy [about] Coinbase even though it’s doing the very thing that Bitcoin was created to deal with and get rid of,” Kim said. \n\nConcerns over centralized actors overshadowing the decentralized purpose of blockchains is also relevant to Ethereum. Ethereum infrastructure provider Infura is an example of a company who has faced criticism in the past for their expanding role as the “gatekeeper” to Ethereum. \n\n“It’s an interesting spectrum and we’ve only just begun on this journey,” said Edgington. “Only a few million people have interacted with the blockchain, any blockchain, so far, and there are a few billion yet to reach. I think we need to make it as easy as possible from them to do so.” \n\nKim and Edgington also discussed the milestone of the Ethereum proof-of-stake network, also called Ethereum 2.0, reaching its one millionth slot. A slot on Eth 2.0 is space for a block containing transactions and user data to be processed and finalized. Every 12 seconds validators, which are the equivalent of miners, can propose a block into a slot and earn rewards. \n\n“It’s just a number, but it’s a good point to take stock of where we are. [Eth 2.0] has been running for four and a half months now and it’s been totally trouble free. It’s just been incredible,” said Edgington. \n\nFinally, the two dissect the post mortem of Ethereum’s latest backwards-incompatible system-wide upgrade known as the Berlin hard fork. Everything didn’t go as planned and, as Kim notes, it’ll become increasingly important that things do work as Ethereum releases more ambitious upgrades in future. \n\nCheck out the full podcast episode hosted by Edington and Kim to get all the latest commentary around Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0. \n\nLinks mentioned in this podcast: What’s New In Eth2 (www.eth2.news)   Valid Points (https://www.coindesk.com/newsletter/valid-points)   \n\n\nInterPop is redefining the future of NFTs and fandom.

It originated from a contentious hard fork of the ethereum blockchain that took place in 2016. Following the creation that year of a decentralized autonomous organization, dubbed The DAO, atop the Ethereum blockchain, hackers managed to exploit vulnerabilities and stole about $60 million of ether. After much debate, the Ethereum network’s code was altered to return the lost funds to investors. But some ethereum nodes objected to the fork on the grounds that it would mean that the blockchain would not be immutable, among other reasons, and decided that they would not run the updated software. These nodes continued to run and mine the pre-fork version of the ethereum blockchain, and it’s now known as ethereum classic. \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eCoinDesk also provides a suite of institutional-grade price indexes.

Its dapp development capability makes EOS similar to \u003ca href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/ethereum-101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e with the notable distinction that transaction confirmations are done through a different type of consensus system. Block producers are chosen by the EOS ecosystem through a voting mechanism known as delegated-proof-of-stake (DPoS). In order to vote, users must stake tokens for three days without selling them, putting them at risk of losing money should the price of the token drop during that time. There is no maximum supply limit of EOS tokens. The delegated proof-of-stake model uses inflation, capped at 5% annually, to fund transactions and pay block users. \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eCoinDesk also provides a suite of institutional-grade price indexes.

With the deployment of both Tendermint’s Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocol and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, blockchains built on top of Cosmos retain their sovereignty while interacting with other blockchains.

The goal was to better organize the develop and decentralization of a cryptocurrency. 60% of block rewards goes to miners and 30% goes to stakeholders to allow for checks and balances.

It was created by Evan Duffield in January of 2014. It was originally known as Darkcoin but later rebranded as Dash in March of 2015. It uses a mix of miners and masternodes to validate transactions. A unique feature of Dash is that it ensures network security by asking all masternodes to stake at least 1,000 DASH in cold storage. Transaction speed can be increased through masternode only validation which excludes miners. Privacy can also be enabled through \u0026#8220;PrivateSend\u0026#8221; transactions that mix units. Dash has a voting system in place that can enable quick changes in governance if required rather than having a hard fork. \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eCoinDesk also provides a suite of institutional-grade price indexes.

BAT measures users’ attention while they browse sites and rewards publishers accordingly. The browser includes an opt-in feature, Brave Rewards, which allows users to anonymously donate BAT to sites that they visit, such as YouTube. Brave claims that more than 150 publishers take part in Brave Rewards, including Wikihow, Archive.org and Smashing Magazine.

Orchid users purchase bandwidth with OXT and node providers receive OXT as rewards for supplying bandwidth. Anyone can become a node or bandwidth provider by staking OXT. Nodes are then randomly selected based on the amount of OXT they have staked and by user-selected parameters such as price and location. Orchid gives users control of their privacy by restricting a website from seeing their IP address and physical location. The total supply of OXT tokens is fixed at 1 billion (minus any that may be burned). However, the circulating supply of OXT is difficult to estimate at any given time as tokens are released into the market at frequent intervals but in irregular amounts. \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eCoinDesk also provides a suite of institutional-grade price indexes.
