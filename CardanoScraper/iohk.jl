This week we have contacted everyone interested (over 2,000) to get a better idea of their experience and expertise. Those of you who have been selected for the first round of this program will hear from us very soon. If you don\u2019t receive an invitation at this stage, don\u2019t worry as we will be running several rounds of this program, so please do stay in touch!\n\n\r\n\r\n## Course structure ##\r\nThe first iteration of the new program starts next week.  The cohort joining this program will be true pioneers. As well as being part of a group that will have *early access* to a set of learning modules, your feedback will help us develop and iterate the overall learning experience.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe course will teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus. The course modules will cover the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including functions and data types, type classes, monads, template Haskell, using the [Plutus Playground](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/01/25/introducing-the-new-plutus-playground/), the [Extended UTXO model](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/), working with Plutus on and off the chain, minting policies, state machines, the Plutus application framework, as well as some case studies and practical exercises. \n\r\n\r\nThe course will follow a modular approach and will be highly interactive \u2013 each week we will be releasing new teaching videos from our director of education, Lars Br\u00fcnjes, along with a set of practical exercises to complete during the week as part of each module. We will also be holding regular Q&A sessions and you will have access to a dedicated community channel on Discord, created especially to help you to connect with other course participants as you learn. \r\n\r\nOutside the exercises and videos, students will be encouraged to learn at a pace that is right for them and to collaborate with fellow students. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week. These moderators are all graduates of the [Mongolia class of 2020](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/21/online-learning-with-haskell-the-mongolia-class-of-2020/) that completed the Haskell MOOC and are well placed to assist with questions and challenges. At the close of each week, Lars will engage directly with the group to resolve more complex technical questions and provide feedback on the subject matter covered that week. \r\n\r\n## Prior experience ##\r\nAs Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language), will be very helpful. At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts. We are also developing education programs for both [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/marlowe/marlowe-explainer.html) and [Glow](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), so don't feel like you have missed out if this Plutus course is not for you. We\u2019re still keen to have you onboard, so do watch this space for details of these other courses!\r\n\r\n## Certification ##\r\nWe will reward participants for their efforts in participating in this course and certify those pioneers that complete the entire program and are successful. These Plutus pioneer certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their knowledge and qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.\r\n \r\n## Ready to start ##\r\nWe are excited to have so many developers from our ecosystem on board and ready to get started and learn Plutus. You\u2019ll not only be learning yourselves, but acting as a pioneer to help us determine the best way to teach and deliver this course \u2013 truly helping pave the way for future cohorts who enroll!

That is a watershed. From a federated network of seven core nodes run by IOHK, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation, we\u2019ll emerge into a decentralized landscape where the stake pool operator (SPOs) community will produce 100% of blocks. \n\nCardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform, founded on peer-reviewed research and delivered through evidence-based software development processes, by a team of world-leading researchers and engineers. From this technocratic core, Cardano exists to steadily redistribute power to the edges \u2013 to a community of individuals. And to empower them as an enabling force for change and progress. \n\nOur SPO community has been instrumental in bringing Cardano to this point. When *d*, the decentralization parameter, [reaches zero](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/04/not-long-till-d-0-day/), SPOs will become responsible for creating all blocks on Cardano.\n\n### Why decentralization?\n\nIn everyday terms, decentralization is the delegation of power from a central authority to a wider group of bodies. But that definition only scrapes the surface in the context of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. \n\nCardano's technical journey to full decentralization continues through phased developments that include degrees of block-production from SPOs, peer-to-peer (P2P) network discovery, and \u2018gossip\u2019 with peers exchanging information among themselves. It involves the deployment of advanced community-led governance and decision-making frameworks, culminating in fully decentralized software and protocol updates. Ultimately, it will result in the creation of a platform wholly and democratically operated and controlled through a global community of SPOs, developers and ada holders.\n\nDecentralization is a core value and driver for Cardano, and we are far from alone in this. The mainstream financial world has recognised that blockchain and the decentralized finance (DeFi) technology it enables has the potential to spawn a new financial system as revolutionary as the internet itself. And that is just part of a trend towards decentralization. Open protocols between renters and providers of data storage that anyone can use have the potential to disrupt the dominant centralized cloud server providers such as Amazon and Microsoft, and there are similar trends affecting video and communication networks and gaming. Cryptocurrencies first brought people into the blockchain world and now the buzz around [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/18/building-native-tokens-on-cardano-for-pleasure-and-profit/) is encouraging them to interact with blockchain in a new, fun way. These trends are introducing blockchain to the mass market.\n\n### Power to the edges\n\nCentralization has shifted the balance of power, from the people to corporations such as Facebook and Google, creating a virtual information monopoly. Because of their unchallenged market positions, centralized authorities enjoy data hegemony over their consumers. \n\nDecentralization is the antidote to this concentration of power and the risks that it brings. Decentralization empowers the individual to make choices and decisions, it returns ownership of personal information to where it belongs, it pushes power to the edges and enables every participant in the network (or ada holder) to have a stake.\n\nThere are three pillars to Cardano's decentralization: block production, networking, and governance. These are intrinsically linked to one another, and work synergistically to create a unified outcome: full decentralization, which lies at their confluence.\n\n### Pillar one: block production\n\nEvery blockchain relies on the addition of new blocks to grow and thrive. With the Byron era deployment, core nodes \u2013 managed by IOHK, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation \u2013 were wholly responsible for creating blocks and maintaining the network. The [advent of Shelley](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/29/from-byron-to-shelley-part-one-the-testnets/) and the Incentivized Testnet in 2019 served as testing ground for decentralized block production. The results demonstrated the viability of such an initiative. In other words, the [Incentivized Testnet experiment proved](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/02/07/shelley-incentivized-testnet-story-in-numbers/) that Cardano could be reliably sustained by a network of community-run stake pools. As of epoch 170 on June 3, 2020, there were 1,299 registered stake pools, 413 of which were creating blocks. \n\nToday, we now have about 2,300 pools, with a healthy proportion creating blocks and rewarding delegates. Some are controlled by exchanges, others by single-pool community operators. All bring value to the network. The former through their ability to bring new ada holders into the ecosystem, the latter through their contribution to continuing decentralization and encouraging grassroots engagement. We are committed to encouraging decentralization, and adjustments this year to parameters such as [k (maximum pool size) and pledge](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/04/not-long-till-d-0-day/) along with our community delegation strategy \u2013 and more on that later this week \u2013 will continue to propel this agenda forward.\n\n### Pillar two: networking\n\nThe second pillar of Cardano's decentralization is the implementation of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, which has also been tested with Shelley. The aim here is to link together geographically distributed pools to provide a secure and robust blockchain platform.\n\nOn mainnet, this feature will use a [set of mini-protocols](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/07/09/cardanos-path-to-decentralization-by-marcin-szamotulski/) and a classification of cold, warm, and hot peers so a given node can make the best decision when selecting connections. From a networking perspective, we are in a hybrid phase where manual processes are required from SPOs to maintain network connections. When *d*=0, all the core nodes will be retired as SPOs take over block production. IOHK will continue to maintain relays but, increasingly, the SPO network will also take on this role. To dig deeper into this, check out this segment of [March\u2019s Cardano360 show](https://youtu.be/mXYIQDUitYI), where Cardano chief architect Duncan Coutts laid out the P2P roadmap.\n\n### Pillar three: governance\n\nThe Goguen roll-out has already introduced transaction metadata *and* [native tokens](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/04/native-tokens-to-bring-new-utility-to-life-on-cardano/) to Cardano. Arguably, this has been the most apparent manifestation of growth and progress for Cardano since the Shelley launch. \n\nYet, at the same time, we have also seen the rise of something even more powerful: an engaged community of builders, creators, and entrepreneurs within Project Catalyst. At the time of writing, the Catalyst community includes 17,000+ worldwide members. This pool of decentralized talent includes entrepreneurs, experts, and specialists across many areas, and provides a vast reservoir of ingenuity to ensure the best and brightest ideas get the funding they deserve. \n\nA layer of solid governance supports the very core of what Cardano is trying to ultimately achieve: a blockchain where a community of stakeholders makes practical decisions about the chain\u2019s protocol and evolution. Catalyst is the precursor to [Voltaire](https://iohk.io/blog/posts/2020/09/10/project-catalyst-voltaire-bring-power-to-the-people/), the development theme that will introduce the third and final level of decentralization through the integration of governance and on-chain decision-making/voting. \n\nVoltaire will introduce: \n\n* Access to funding via a decentralized treasury (worth some $400m at the current ada price) within a governance framework where the community will have the power, through their ada stake, to influence Cardano's future direction\n* Decentralized decision-making on enhancements, network improvements, and parameter updates\n* Fully decentralized software updates: the process enabling decentralized, open participation for fair voting on decisions about system and protocol advancements\n\n### Conclusion: the fall of centralization\n\nDecentralized block production \u2013 done. P2P networking \u2013 rolling out from April. Governance? Project Catalyst is on a roll and there is much more to come. \n\nFrom a federated chain with centralized block production, to a chain with blocks wholly minted by the community. We are well on our way. When we have completed building all three pillars, we shall have created something truly unique. A network that is robust and resilient, yet flexible and adaptable to future growth. A platform that serves its users today, while empowering them to build fresh value and functionality for tomorrow. All within a democratic framework where the community makes the calls.

To dig deeper into this, check out this segment of [March\u2019s Cardano360 show](https://youtu.be/mXYIQDUitYI), where Cardano chief architect Duncan Coutts laid out the P2P roadmap.\n\n### Pillar three: governance\n\nThe Goguen roll-out has already introduced transaction metadata *and* [native tokens](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/04/native-tokens-to-bring-new-utility-to-life-on-cardano/) to Cardano. Arguably, this has been the most apparent manifestation of growth and progress for Cardano since the Shelley launch. \n\nYet, at the same time, we have also seen the rise of something even more powerful: an engaged community of builders, creators, and entrepreneurs within Project Catalyst. At the time of writing, the Catalyst community includes 17,000+ worldwide members. This pool of decentralized talent includes entrepreneurs, experts, and specialists across many areas, and provides a vast reservoir of ingenuity to ensure the best and brightest ideas get the funding they deserve. \n\nA layer of solid governance supports the very core of what Cardano is trying to ultimately achieve: a blockchain where a community of stakeholders makes practical decisions about the chain\u2019s protocol and evolution. Catalyst is the precursor to [Voltaire](https://iohk.io/blog/posts/2020/09/10/project-catalyst-voltaire-bring-power-to-the-people/), the development theme that will introduce the third and final level of decentralization through the integration of governance and on-chain decision-making/voting. \n\nVoltaire will introduce: \n\n* Access to funding via a decentralized treasury (worth some $400m at the current ada price) within a governance framework where the community will have the power, through their ada stake, to influence Cardano's future direction\n* Decentralized decision-making on enhancements, network improvements, and parameter updates\n* Fully decentralized software updates: the process enabling decentralized, open participation for fair voting on decisions about system and protocol advancements\n\n### Conclusion: the fall of centralization\n\nDecentralized block production \u2013 done. P2P networking \u2013 rolling out from April. Governance? Project Catalyst is on a roll and there is much more to come. \n\nFrom a federated chain with centralized block production, to a chain with blocks wholly minted by the community. We are well on our way. When we have completed building all three pillars, we shall have created something truly unique. A network that is robust and resilient, yet flexible and adaptable to future growth. A platform that serves its users today, while empowering them to build fresh value and functionality for tomorrow. All within a democratic framework where the community makes the calls.

Naturally, this mechanism requires public declaration of the bitstring and explicit, cryptographically secure approval: specifically, only a collection of digitally signed votes from genesis delegates can complete the process.

Recalling the hash chain structure of the Ouroboros blockchain, this hash value depends on the entire blockchain up to that point.\n\nClosely examining the correctness proofs of the protocol paints a more precise picture of the essential properties of the transition nonce: it must rely on random values \u2013 introduced in our setting via Cardano blockchain transactions \u2013 that cannot be predicted accurately when the stake distribution for the April 10 epoch is settled.

More than 10 years ago, I was using Kiva, a microfinance lending platform, and it awoke a long journey of mine to read books like Muhammad Yunus\u2019 Banker for the Poor and start having a discussion about the question: why does the world have fractured financial systems? And why is it the case that people for no fault of their own, if they lose the geographic lottery, are born into systems that will keep them perpetually poor, regardless of how hard they work or the quality of their character?\n\nThis led me to the cryptocurrency space. I didn't really care too much for arguments about proof-of-work or proof-of-stake or how Bitcoin transactions worked or any of these details. What mattered to me was the utility of the system for bringing economic identity to the billions who don't have it. And I knew that this concept of decentralization, this concept of having a blockchain that serves as a place to timestamp things, to audit things, a place to broker trust amongst people who don't trust each other, was truly something revolutionary and magical. But it was a great invention that came without a user manual, and without batteries included. In the 10 years since I joined the cryptocurrency space, it's been my life mission to build systems that have the capacity to act as a backbone for utilities and social structures that will enable a great merging of the markets of the world.\n\nThe aim is that those who are the poorest amongst us will enjoy the same financial systems as those who are the richest. It's a simple idea, but in practice, almost impossible to achieve with legacy systems. And the crown jewel of our labors has been the Cardano protocol. We started in 2015 building the Cardano protocol specifically to figure out how to accommodate this concept of economic identity, how to build applications that would be equally useful\u00a0 to someone in a basement in the US as they are to a shepherd in Senegal.\n\n## Building capacity\u00a0\n\nWe also realized that in addition to doing great science and great engineering, it would take quite a bit of time for us to actually figure out how to deploy these systems within the developing world. That meant we physically had to move to those countries. And thus in 2017, after we were a bit more mature as a company, we opened up offices in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We built extensions into Rwanda and Uganda, and we found great partners. We also started exploring places like Mongolia, Georgia, and South American nations as well. We were all unified with a common cause and purpose. How do we enable a system to operate from the bottom up instead of the top down? How do we figure out how to give people self-sovereign identity and put them in control of their own money, control of their own future, and give them a platform to build upon?\u00a0\n\nHow could we allow them to secure credit and retain property? Then to protect and secure that through insurance and other products. Now, that four-year journey, since establishing that office in Ethiopia, has yielded some amazing fruit. First off, we've had the incredible opportunity to meet many world leaders who are aligned with many NGOs and charities that are directly aligned with our goal. We've also been able to train local talent and hire local people. They have made this their tireless life mission. In many cases they did this with few resources and, in many cases, exposed to uncaring bureaucracies or corruption, waste, fraud, and abuse, and just plain old-fashioned setbacks.\u00a0\n\n## Transforming lives\n\nWe've seen our own setbacks. Some of the countries we've chosen to be in have had unrest. Some of the countries we've chosen to work with have had regimes change. As a consequence, things that we thought would be happening sooner took a little bit longer. With that said, we are on the cusp of deals and initiatives, this year, which will bring millions of users through public private partnerships into the Cardano ecosystem. And what does that mean? Really? What does that mean?\u00a0\n\nIt means that a large group of people, for the first time in their lives, will have a digital identity that can be linked to a digital wallet. That also can be linked to payment systems, which also can be linked to property. These can then enjoy rich metadata and other such things. And this is the highest goal, because if we can achieve these things, then it means functionally a new economy built on the great liquification of trillions of dollars of wealth. You see, the reality is that Africa is not a poor continent and African nations collectively are not poor.\n\nThey are, rather, in a situation where they have tremendous potential and real wealth, but that wealth is inaccessible because of bad systems and a difficulty in globalizing the continent\u2019s nation states. This is a tremendous opportunity. The reality is when you look to the future, you don't want to go to where the ball is now, you want to go to where the ball will be. In other words, you want to go where the economies are going to grow the fastest and see the greatest opportunity.\u00a0\n\n## China to Africa\n\nWe saw this in the 1980s with the surging of China. It was a common notion then, amongst people in Wall Street and London and Japan and other places, that China was a very poor nation with many systemic problems. But amongst the very specialized actors who truly understood where things were going, they realized that changes in those systems had built up to a position where China in just a few decades would become one of the richest and most powerful nations in the world.\n\nSimilarly, when you look at the demographics of Africa, you look at the generation that will take custodianship of the continent. You see that 70% of Ethiopians are at, or under, the age of 30. Many of these people are growing up with a cell phone in their hand, with access to the internet. They have access to education, thanks to MOOCs, thanks to YouTube and other free platforms. And so the bridge of human capital has occurred. And you have a group of people who are tremendously ambitious and impatient, and will not tolerate the bureaucracy of the past and will not tolerate the sins of the past. Whatever systems stand in the way of progress will soon come collapsing down. And in that wake, that vacuum is a marketplace for new systems.\n\n## A new generation\n\nMy country has trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of social infrastructure. In the United States, for our financial markets, for our legal system, for every single thing, from how our healthcare works, to how we die, there's a law or regulation or some bureaucracy that stands in the way. In many cases, these things hold and stabilize our society, but they make us less resilient, less adaptable, and also they slow down progress. And they hinder the ability to chase the future when there is a potential for completely new systems, which in many cases are orders of magnitude more efficient at a much lower cost. That is going to result in a huge competitive advantage for the nations that adopt the new systems first. The first countries that hold national elections online that are credible, free, fair, and auditable are likely to be African nations. They will be first countries to have an end-to-end digital identity and economy.\n\nThis offers great potential for African nations \u2013 not Germany, not France, not Britain, not the United States, not China, not Japan. This is an all-you-can-eat buffet of innovation, progress and new systems, and my industry, the blockchain industry, is interconnected with this. \u2018New\u2019 is what we do. We find ways to build trust amongst people who don't trust each other. We find ways to change everything, from monetary policy to the concept of identity, to the concept of property.\u00a0\n\nSo we built infrastructure in Ethiopia, amongst other places on the continent. We did that knowing the infrastructure would be used to service large government deals. We adopted the push model, where we push these things to the citizens of countries, and began a systemic campaign of innovation across the continent. The other magic of Cardano is that it comes with a funding system called Catalyst. Today, right now at the current price of ada, over a quarter billion dollars, $250 million, is available for grants. For those who wish to build infrastructure, applications, and services and products in the Cardano ecosystem.\u00a0\n\n## Africa leading the way\n\nIt is our belief and hope that over the next five years, a meaningful percentage of the entrepreneurs who deploy infrastructure will come with a pan-African view. It could be a peer-to-peer lending system; it could be a remittance system; an ATM network; basic internet access; a micro ISP. It could be power generation. And this is not only a goal \u2013 it's something we're investing heavily in, with partners like ICE Addis, which gives us access to entrepreneurs. And in more than 25 countries in Africa over the next five years, our staff on the ground will likely scale from the dozens to the hundreds, if not the thousands. And, instead of having one headquarters, it's likely we'll have four or five headquarters covering the continent.\n\nFor example, we've started a campaign to build up resources and access and personnel in Ghana. I will also try to do the same in places such as Rwanda. And what we have found in every place we go is a welcoming attitude, and a lot of grace and intelligence. For example, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia is a cryptographer. My country is ruled by a president in his late seventies. Ethiopia is ruled by a person who can actually read the academic papers. This is a stark contrast in both age and outlook. The potential for Ethiopia reminds me of the early days of Singapore as an independent country and the wisdom and judgment that was going into the growth and management of that country. And I think the exact same thing can be done with a helping hand here and there in a way that benefits as many people as possible.\n\n## New frontiers\n\nSo, we're super excited and we've been investing in everything, like identity. The PRISM team is our entry point into identity and has over a dozen people. That team has expanded by 30 people and to our ability to tender and bid for contracts. We wanted to seal some flagship contracts first, and those are coming to a close, which will bring millions of people into Cardano. And then those will stabilize as a foundation from which we can do business with dozens of entities and countries, both public and private. And the people responsible for that are scaling up very rapidly to train far more developers, to train far more entrepreneurs, and then give those entrepreneurs access to marketplaces and capital so that they can liquify the wealth of Africa and benefit from it. You see, many people tend to look at this as a charity problem. I think that's both the wrong way and also fundamentally dehumanizing.\n\nI look at this as ultimately a new market, a new frontier where we can find new partners to work with. It is not our goal to save people or to give anything away. It's our goal to build partners, collaborate and create wealth, and share that with our partners. I cannot imagine what it means to be born in Zambia or Zimbabwe or South Africa. It's not my life and it's not my experience, but there are millions who have that life and experience. What I can imagine, though, is how to build a great business with people born in those places and for us to build wealth together. That's the point of blockchain technology. It's a great unifier. It's a great engine of trust. It's a great engine of economic progress and creation. As blockchain entrepreneurs, without permission, government aid or centralized coordination, we have built an ecosystem worth $1 trillion, looking at the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and Cardano and others, and that's just 10 years into this game.\u00a0\n\n## Increasing opportunities\n\nWe've also spurred a movement with tens of millions of people all across the planet, from nomads and Mongolia to shepherds in Senegal. Each and every one of them can run their entire life from a cell phone without relying upon a central agency. And over the next 10 years, we could see growth of another order of magnitude and the totality of our ecosystem could be $10 trillion, $15 trillion, $20 trillion. And the majority of that could be owned by those in developing nations, such as Ethiopia, such as Uganda, such as Chile, That could be the greatest achievement of systems in the past century, bettering the lives of all and reducing the problems of all. So, it's very exciting to be here. It's great to be part of these events and to see the rollout in a very short period of time.\n\nWe're going to announce an Africa focus in our company, and we'll be able to show everybody all the different programs and pilots and projects and partners, and the vision of what we're going to invest in over the next three to five years. It is the privilege of a lifetime as an entrepreneur to be able to participate in these markets in this way. I literally get to wake up every single day and talk to the most ambitious, honest, and hardworking people I've ever met in my life and find ways to build systems with them that not only make their lives better, but produce wealth for all of us. And if I'm right in my hypothesis, I believe that Africa will make the Chinese miracle that we witnessed over the past three decades become the African miracle, which will dwarf anything China has accomplished and perhaps make Africa one of the most valuable continents in human history.\n\n## A seat at the table\n\nIt happened before with the great Mansa Musa, and I think it definitely can happen again, if we build the right systems. It would be a travesty if those systems allowed that wealth to aggregate only in one place. In my view, it is incredibly important that we remember the first principle of the cryptocurrency space, that we are all truly equal and there is no centralized power.\n\nThe magic of the systems that we build and engineer is that everybody has a say, no matter where they come from or who they are. And everybody has a seat at the table in being able to decide the trajectory of their life and to keep the fruits of their labors. So thank you so much for coming, and I hope you enjoy this conference as much as I do, and I hope you choose to invest in Africa as much as I have. I think it's the best investment any business can make. And I also believe it's the most rewarding work any person can do.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Blockchain Africa 2021: Charles Hoskinson's keynote speech", "subtitle": "The following is a lightly edited transcript from Charles Hoskinson\u2019s speech on March 18th, 2021 at Blockchain Africa 2021 outlining IOHK\u2019s vision for Africa.", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\n\n\nAfrica and the topic of banking and the unbanked, the topic of economic identity, is something that's near and dear to my heart. More than 10 years ago, I was using Kiva, a microfinance lending platform, and it awoke a long journey of mine to read books like Muhammad Yunus\u2019 Banker for the Poor and start having a discussion about the question: why does the world have fractured financial systems? And why is it the case that people for no fault of their own, if they lose the geographic lottery, are born into systems that will keep them perpetually poor, regardless of how hard they work or the quality of their character?\n\nThis led me to the cryptocurrency space. I didn't really care too much for arguments about proof-of-work or proof-of-stake or how Bitcoin transactions worked or any of these details. What mattered to me was the utility of the system for bringing economic identity to the billions who don't have it. And I knew that this concept of decentralization, this concept of having a blockchain that serves as a place to timestamp things, to audit things, a place to broker trust amongst people who don't trust each other, was truly something revolutionary and magical. But it was a great invention that came without a user manual, and without batteries included. In the 10 years since I joined the cryptocurrency space, it's been my life mission to build systems that have the capacity to act as a backbone for utilities and social structures that will enable a great merging of the markets of the world.\n\nThe aim is that those who are the poorest amongst us will enjoy the same financial systems as those who are the richest. It's a simple idea, but in practice, almost impossible to achieve with legacy systems. And the crown jewel of our labors has been the Cardano protocol. We started in 2015 building the Cardano protocol specifically to figure out how to accommodate this concept of economic identity, how to build applications that would be equally useful\u00a0 to someone in a basement in the US as they are to a shepherd in Senegal.\n\n## Building capacity\u00a0\n\nWe also realized that in addition to doing great science and great engineering, it would take quite a bit of time for us to actually figure out how to deploy these systems within the developing world. That meant we physically had to move to those countries. And thus in 2017, after we were a bit more mature as a company, we opened up offices in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We built extensions into Rwanda and Uganda, and we found great partners. We also started exploring places like Mongolia, Georgia, and South American nations as well. We were all unified with a common cause and purpose. How do we enable a system to operate from the bottom up instead of the top down? How do we figure out how to give people self-sovereign identity and put them in control of their own money, control of their own future, and give them a platform to build upon?\u00a0\n\nHow could we allow them to secure credit and retain property? Then to protect and secure that through insurance and other products. Now, that four-year journey, since establishing that office in Ethiopia, has yielded some amazing fruit. First off, we've had the incredible opportunity to meet many world leaders who are aligned with many NGOs and charities that are directly aligned with our goal. We've also been able to train local talent and hire local people. They have made this their tireless life mission. In many cases they did this with few resources and, in many cases, exposed to uncaring bureaucracies or corruption, waste, fraud, and abuse, and just plain old-fashioned setbacks.\u00a0\n\n## Transforming lives\n\nWe've seen our own setbacks. Some of the countries we've chosen to be in have had unrest. Some of the countries we've chosen to work with have had regimes change. As a consequence, things that we thought would be happening sooner took a little bit longer. With that said, we are on the cusp of deals and initiatives, this year, which will bring millions of users through public private partnerships into the Cardano ecosystem. And what does that mean? Really? What does that mean?\u00a0\n\nIt means that a large group of people, for the first time in their lives, will have a digital identity that can be linked to a digital wallet. That also can be linked to payment systems, which also can be linked to property. These can then enjoy rich metadata and other such things. And this is the highest goal, because if we can achieve these things, then it means functionally a new economy built on the great liquification of trillions of dollars of wealth. You see, the reality is that Africa is not a poor continent and African nations collectively are not poor.\n\nThey are, rather, in a situation where they have tremendous potential and real wealth, but that wealth is inaccessible because of bad systems and a difficulty in globalizing the continent\u2019s nation states. This is a tremendous opportunity. The reality is when you look to the future, you don't want to go to where the ball is now, you want to go to where the ball will be. In other words, you want to go where the economies are going to grow the fastest and see the greatest opportunity.\u00a0\n\n## China to Africa\n\nWe saw this in the 1980s with the surging of China. It was a common notion then, amongst people in Wall Street and London and Japan and other places, that China was a very poor nation with many systemic problems. But amongst the very specialized actors who truly understood where things were going, they realized that changes in those systems had built up to a position where China in just a few decades would become one of the richest and most powerful nations in the world.\n\nSimilarly, when you look at the demographics of Africa, you look at the generation that will take custodianship of the continent. You see that 70% of Ethiopians are at, or under, the age of 30. Many of these people are growing up with a cell phone in their hand, with access to the internet. They have access to education, thanks to MOOCs, thanks to YouTube and other free platforms. And so the bridge of human capital has occurred. And you have a group of people who are tremendously ambitious and impatient, and will not tolerate the bureaucracy of the past and will not tolerate the sins of the past. Whatever systems stand in the way of progress will soon come collapsing down. And in that wake, that vacuum is a marketplace for new systems.\n\n## A new generation\n\nMy country has trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of social infrastructure. In the United States, for our financial markets, for our legal system, for every single thing, from how our healthcare works, to how we die, there's a law or regulation or some bureaucracy that stands in the way. In many cases, these things hold and stabilize our society, but they make us less resilient, less adaptable, and also they slow down progress. And they hinder the ability to chase the future when there is a potential for completely new systems, which in many cases are orders of magnitude more efficient at a much lower cost. That is going to result in a huge competitive advantage for the nations that adopt the new systems first. The first countries that hold national elections online that are credible, free, fair, and auditable are likely to be African nations. They will be first countries to have an end-to-end digital identity and economy.\n\nThis offers great potential for African nations \u2013 not Germany, not France, not Britain, not the United States, not China, not Japan. This is an all-you-can-eat buffet of innovation, progress and new systems, and my industry, the blockchain industry, is interconnected with this. \u2018New\u2019 is what we do. We find ways to build trust amongst people who don't trust each other. We find ways to change everything, from monetary policy to the concept of identity, to the concept of property.\u00a0\n\nSo we built infrastructure in Ethiopia, amongst other places on the continent. We did that knowing the infrastructure would be used to service large government deals. We adopted the push model, where we push these things to the citizens of countries, and began a systemic campaign of innovation across the continent. The other magic of Cardano is that it comes with a funding system called Catalyst. Today, right now at the current price of ada, over a quarter billion dollars, $250 million, is available for grants. For those who wish to build infrastructure, applications, and services and products in the Cardano ecosystem.\u00a0\n\n## Africa leading the way\n\nIt is our belief and hope that over the next five years, a meaningful percentage of the entrepreneurs who deploy infrastructure will come with a pan-African view. It could be a peer-to-peer lending system; it could be a remittance system; an ATM network; basic internet access; a micro ISP. It could be power generation. And this is not only a goal \u2013 it's something we're investing heavily in, with partners like ICE Addis, which gives us access to entrepreneurs. And in more than 25 countries in Africa over the next five years, our staff on the ground will likely scale from the dozens to the hundreds, if not the thousands. And, instead of having one headquarters, it's likely we'll have four or five headquarters covering the continent.\n\nFor example, we've started a campaign to build up resources and access and personnel in Ghana. I will also try to do the same in places such as Rwanda. And what we have found in every place we go is a welcoming attitude, and a lot of grace and intelligence. For example, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia is a cryptographer. My country is ruled by a president in his late seventies. Ethiopia is ruled by a person who can actually read the academic papers. This is a stark contrast in both age and outlook. The potential for Ethiopia reminds me of the early days of Singapore as an independent country and the wisdom and judgment that was going into the growth and management of that country. And I think the exact same thing can be done with a helping hand here and there in a way that benefits as many people as possible.\n\n## New frontiers\n\nSo, we're super excited and we've been investing in everything, like identity.

More recently, cryptocurrencies, and digital assets in general, have seen a resurgence in interest from Bloomberg\u2019s customers. Bitcoin recently hit an all-time high of $60,000. Meanwhile, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have entered the mainstream, following the recent sale of artist Beeple\u2019s entirely digital work, [Everydays: the first 5000 days](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/entirely-digital-artwork-just-sold-major-auction-first-time-180977039/) for $69m, just as Cardano has launched native tokens on the network.\n\n\n\nThe addition of ada to Bloomberg Terminal is the latest chapter in a year of continuing momentum and growing credibility in the eyes of the financial industry.

Nonetheless, it remains a validation of the work the whole community has done to get here and a powerful marker of our continuing momentum.\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "momentum-continues-as-coinbase-lists-ada-and-bloomberg-adds-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/03/17/momentum-continues-as-coinbase-lists-ada-and-bloomberg-adds-cardano/", "read_time": 4}], "recentPosts": [{"publish_date": "2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z", "author": {"title": "Niamh Ahern", "display_name": "Niamh Ahern", "thumbnail": "https://ucarecdn.com/8ac49795-0145-4168-8d90-d667340a7ac8/", "is_team_member": true, "is_active": true, "localized": [{"job_titles": [{"name": "Technical Writer", "primary": null}, {"name": "Education", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "niamh.ahern@iohk.io", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/niamh-ahern-67849949/", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/nahern_iohk?lang=en", "github": "https://github.com/nahern"}}], "job_titles": [{"name": "Technical Writer", "primary": null}, {"name": "Education", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "niamh.ahern@iohk.io", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/niamh-ahern-67849949/", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/nahern_iohk?lang=en", "github": "https://github.com/nahern"}, "profile_url": "/blog/authors/niamh-ahern/", "blog_posts": [{"publish_date": "2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/350386c8-b07f-44f0-9787-0c898a3d0460/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways. These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways.

This week we have contacted everyone interested (over 2,000) to get a better idea of their experience and expertise. Those of you who have been selected for the first round of this program will hear from us very soon. If you don\u2019t receive an invitation at this stage, don\u2019t worry as we will be running several rounds of this program, so please do stay in touch!\n\n\r\n\r\n## Course structure ##\r\nThe first iteration of the new program starts next week.  The cohort joining this program will be true pioneers. As well as being part of a group that will have *early access* to a set of learning modules, your feedback will help us develop and iterate the overall learning experience.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe course will teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus. The course modules will cover the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including functions and data types, type classes, monads, template Haskell, using the [Plutus Playground](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/01/25/introducing-the-new-plutus-playground/), the [Extended UTXO model](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/), working with Plutus on and off the chain, minting policies, state machines, the Plutus application framework, as well as some case studies and practical exercises. \n\r\n\r\nThe course will follow a modular approach and will be highly interactive \u2013 each week we will be releasing new teaching videos from our director of education, Lars Br\u00fcnjes, along with a set of practical exercises to complete during the week as part of each module. We will also be holding regular Q&A sessions and you will have access to a dedicated community channel on Discord, created especially to help you to connect with other course participants as you learn. \r\n\r\nOutside the exercises and videos, students will be encouraged to learn at a pace that is right for them and to collaborate with fellow students. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week. These moderators are all graduates of the [Mongolia class of 2020](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/21/online-learning-with-haskell-the-mongolia-class-of-2020/) that completed the Haskell MOOC and are well placed to assist with questions and challenges. At the close of each week, Lars will engage directly with the group to resolve more complex technical questions and provide feedback on the subject matter covered that week. \r\n\r\n## Prior experience ##\r\nAs Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language), will be very helpful. At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts. We are also developing education programs for both [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/marlowe/marlowe-explainer.html) and [Glow](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), so don't feel like you have missed out if this Plutus course is not for you. We\u2019re still keen to have you onboard, so do watch this space for details of these other courses!\r\n\r\n## Certification ##\r\nWe will reward participants for their efforts in participating in this course and certify those pioneers that complete the entire program and are successful. These Plutus pioneer certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their knowledge and qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.\r\n \r\n## Ready to start ##\r\nWe are excited to have so many developers from our ecosystem on board and ready to get started and learn Plutus. You\u2019ll not only be learning yourselves, but acting as a pioneer to help us determine the best way to teach and deliver this course \u2013 truly helping pave the way for future cohorts who enroll!

This week we have contacted everyone interested (over 2,000) to get a better idea of their experience and expertise. Those of you who have been selected for the first round of this program will hear from us very soon. If you don\u2019t receive an invitation at this stage, don\u2019t worry as we will be running several rounds of this program, so please do stay in touch!\n\n\r\n\r\n## Course structure ##\r\nThe first iteration of the new program starts next week.  The cohort joining this program will be true pioneers. As well as being part of a group that will have *early access* to a set of learning modules, your feedback will help us develop and iterate the overall learning experience.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe course will teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus. The course modules will cover the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including functions and data types, type classes, monads, template Haskell, using the [Plutus Playground](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/01/25/introducing-the-new-plutus-playground/), the [Extended UTXO model](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/), working with Plutus on and off the chain, minting policies, state machines, the Plutus application framework, as well as some case studies and practical exercises. \n\r\n\r\nThe course will follow a modular approach and will be highly interactive \u2013 each week we will be releasing new teaching videos from our director of education, Lars Br\u00fcnjes, along with a set of practical exercises to complete during the week as part of each module. We will also be holding regular Q&A sessions and you will have access to a dedicated community channel on Discord, created especially to help you to connect with other course participants as you learn. \r\n\r\nOutside the exercises and videos, students will be encouraged to learn at a pace that is right for them and to collaborate with fellow students. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week.

IOHK has relaunched the Mantis project to mitigate against the recent attacks, provide enhanced security, and establish a robust means of interacting with the ETC chain. A commitment to fostering innovation and sustainability lies at the heart of the project. We are aiming to provide a steady funding income with the establishment of a proto-treasury to nurture future development and growth. This Mantis re-launch represents the culmination of a project that we've been working on for some time. Over the past few months, we have resurrected our code base, and gathered a dedicated Mantis team together who have worked hard to refine and improve the code and deliver important new features.\n\n## What\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Mantis\u00a0project?\n\nMantis is a project that is built for the community, specifically designed for the developers, wallet users, and infrastructure providers to enable direct interaction with the ETC blockchain. Essentially, it is a place where future development can evolve and be tested by the community. The Mantis release includes the following components:\n- Mantis client - a CLI tool that connects to other clients in a peer-to-peer manner to allow users to communicate with the ETC chain, send and receive transactions, sync the blockchain data, execute and validate smart contracts, and deploy new smart contracts on-chain.\r\n- Mantis wallet - a node wallet with incorporated graphical user interface (GUI), which connects to both mainnet and the Sagano and Mordor testnets. \r\n- Mantis faucet - enables developers to receive testnet funds for use on the Sagano and Mordor testnets.\r\n- Mantis explorer - allows tracking recent activities and transactions in regards to the ETC chain, covering the ETC mainnet, and Sagano and Mordor testnets. \n\nPlease visit the [Mantis website](https://mantisclient.io/) where you can download the latest version of both the Mantis client and wallet.\r\n\r\nMantis software implements the official Ethereum Classic specification and Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals [(ECIPs)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) introduced by ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem. The project has undergone a number of enhancements in terms of adding robustness and variety to the client offering, including optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term. It has been developed from the ground up and built in 100% Scala code, a functional programming language that offers security guarantees that other languages do not. Mantis features include stable peer discovery, pruning, fast synchronization, and newly implemented checkpointing (for 51% attack resistance) and proto-treasury (for long-term sustainability). Let\u2019s take a closer look at these features.\n\n## Checkpointing \r\n*Persistence* and *liveness* are two crucial properties that a transaction ledger should possess. It is a proven fact that both persistence and liveness suffer when the adversarial mining power in the proof of work surpasses 50%, and in the recent year, ETC has undergone several double-spending attacks prompted by the creation of large chain reorganizations. Considering that persistence and liveness were not guaranteed within the ETC network, we sought to implement protocol changes that will re-establish persistence and liveness under current network conditions, and *checkpointing* is one of the proposed solutions. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered, by using the *k* parameter, or depth parameter, where every *k* block gets irreversibly \"checkpointed\", meaning that no one can ever drop or revert it. A trusted authority can choose the block on which to issue a checkpoint, which means that they can decide which block becomes the canonical chain that all parties should follow. This trusted authority must run continuously and is responsible for publishing the checkpoint to the network. Checkpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered with regards to mining. The mining rewards are not affected and the checkpointing federation can only issue checkpoints on blocks that have valid proof of work and cannot mint blocks on its own. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing is now implemented within the Mantis project, and according to our recent [ECIP comparison for 51% attack resistance](https://static.iohk.io/docs/etc/ecip-comparison-for-51-attack-resistance.pdf), it provides far greater, and importantly formally proven, security against these types of attacks. It is important that any 51% attack mitigation is truly robust enough to give absolute certainty to ETC holders, users, and service providers that their transactions will be secure.\r\n\n## Proto-Treasury\r\nFor the longer-term health and success of the ETC ecosystem, we position network growth, sustainability, and innovation as key elements to ensure network security. With that in mind, we are implementing a proto-treasury system within the Mantis project to establish a steady funding income.  A well-developed governance strategy will enable effective, distributed funding for the long-term development of Mantis, whereas a decentralized treasury would ensure two important things for the future of the ecosystem:\r\n- Firstly, it would provide a permanent ongoing source of funding for the ETC network. while increasing the value of the ecosystem and promoting greater developer engagement. \r\n\r\n- Secondly, it would provide a distributed and transparent funding mechanism, which lets the ETC community determine its future growth and enable the sustainability required for innovation and growth.\r\n\r\nEstablishing the treasury for funding purposes ensures a clear vision of the substantial system maintenance focused to obtain innovation and diversity from other projects, including proof of stake (PoS) and newer blockchains. This solution is straightforward in its optimization for speed and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal foresees to distribute 80% of existing mining rewards to miners and 20% to the proto-treasury smart contract. The treasury will be controlled by the community and will enable a decentralized, collaborative decision-making process, offering an opt-in type collaboration for those who are interested.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\r\nAs much as we\u2019re excited about the Mantis relaunch, it should be stressed that its capability won\u2019t be limited to just the features outlined here. Mantis is an evolving project and right now we are establishing its foundational building blocks and running rigorous security audits. Further down the road, it will see more performance improvements in terms of CPU, GPU and ASICs compatibility, a new proof-of-work consensus protocol and algorithm introduction (PRISM consensus, Keccak256 algorithm) and, of course, additional enhancements for better interoperability and speed of transaction processing.

Our mission is to grow our global community and business through the medium of education, and to share what we have learned. By claiming leadership in worldwide education on blockchain technology, we have the chance to shape the field for generations and to leave a lasting legacy.\n\nA consistent theme from 2019 has been the demand for a broad range of educational content, as demonstrated by the feedback received about the Incentivized Testnet, as well as the steady flow of support requests to our helpdesk. A key focus in IOHK for 2020 is to develop and expand our education materials as we transition fully into the Shelley era and then to the Goguen era of Cardano.\n\nThe IOHK education team will be investing significant time and effort this year in broadening our range of materials. We aim to enhance understanding of our technologies using a variety of learning and training assets targeted at a wide range of stakeholder audiences, both internal and external. This will be vital as the use of IOHK technology moves into the mainstream. We also aim to provide knowledge and information to enterprise decision-makers so they know what business problems our technologies can solve. We have lots planned and many projects are underway as we grow Cardano into a global social and financial operating system.\n\n## What can you expect?\n\nWe started 2020 with lectures, by Dr Lars Br\u00fcnjes, our director of education, at the University of Malta. The focus of these lectures was on Plutus and Marlowe, our programming languages for smart contracts. The fruits of these sessions will, in turn, form the foundation of some modular training materials that we plan to formalize and develop over the coming months.\n\nOur free Udemy courses on [Plutus](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/) and [Marlowe](https://www.udemy.com/course/marlowe-programming-language/) by Alejandro Garcia have proven very popular, with over 5,000 students signed up. Feedback has been positive and, as a result of what we learned from our students, we\u2019ve been making incremental improvements over the last year. We now want to take this to the next level and are planning to fully update both courses soon to bring them up to speed with the latest development changes and new features. We are also in the initial planning stages for a second edition of the ebook, [Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts](https://leanpub.com/plutus-smart-contracts) by Lars Br\u00fcnjes and Polina Vinogradova, which we will be publishing later this year. The writing team has started to identify improvements and we are also gathering feedback directly from readers. If you have suggestions, please raise a pull request in our [Plutus ebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-book) with your ideas.\n\nAn important step in bridging the gap between our academic papers and mainstream understanding of these concepts is to teach people about Ouroboros, the proof-of-stake protocol that powers Cardano and ada. In response to the valuable feedback we have received from running the Incentivized Testnet, we are planning to create varied educational content to help stake pool operators understand Ouroboros and how the protocol works on a practical level.\n\n## Broadening our reach\n\nTo broaden the reach of our training courses and content, we are also investigating a way to migrate our popular Haskell training course into a massive online course, or MOOC, while also making it more comprehensive with the inclusion of Plutus and Marlowe material. In this way, we hope our MOOC will make the course even more valuable, and provide access to the widest possible global community. In addition, we are planning a comprehensive classroom-based Haskell and Plutus course in Mongolia, details of which will be finalized soon. We plan to use the introductory part of the online Haskell course as a primer for this face-to-face training. This is an example of a core efficiency that we are embracing where we aim to reuse content on Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe across a variety of stand-alone modular materials that we can use externally and within the company for developing our staff.\n\nWe appreciate the value of interactive and meaningful training workshops, so we intend to host many more this year in several locations around the world. These events are in the initial planning stages and the first in the series will take place in Quebec in the spring. We\u2019ll announce more details through our official channels \u2013 Twitter, email, here \u2013 nearer the time. The IOHK education team are on hand to support and prepare the necessary learning tools for participants to use at these events.\n\nAlongside these materials and courses, we are mentoring an undergraduate student at the International University of Management (ISM), with her thesis on the topic of the power of blockchain in emerging markets. Additionally, Dr Jamie Gabbay has been invited to contribute to the book '*Applications of new generation technology to cryptocurrencies, banking, and finance*\u2019 by Devraj Basu.\n\n## Internal initiatives\n\nWe are also working with our human resources team to build the IOHK Training Academy: a new learning portal for our internal teams to upskill and develop professionally. This new resource is part of our learning and development strategy that aims to improve employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We want to provide access to a library of assets so our staff can easily find exactly what they need. We will be developing tailored \u2018learning journeys\u2019 by function, ready-made content that will help people develop skills in new areas, as well as creating specific onboarding journeys for new starters. This is a vital resource for a fast-growing company with staff and contractors spread across 43 countries and will prove to be an important asset for all our people.\n\n2020 is going to be a pivotal year for Cardano and we are looking forward to playing our part. It is our aim to teach both individuals and organizations how to use the protocol, and how it can help with their everyday lives. We have lots to do and we look forward to sharing all the educational content that we produce with our existing community, as well as those of you who are new to Cardano. ", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Educating the world on Cardano: initiatives and plans for 2020", "subtitle": "Learn more about the education team's plans for the upcoming year", "audio": null, "soundcloud": null, "body_content": "Education has always been a key part of IOHK\u2019s strategy. Our mission is to grow our global community and business through the medium of education, and to share what we have learned. By claiming leadership in worldwide education on blockchain technology, we have the chance to shape the field for generations and to leave a lasting legacy.\n\nA consistent theme from 2019 has been the demand for a broad range of educational content, as demonstrated by the feedback received about the Incentivized Testnet, as well as the steady flow of support requests to our helpdesk. A key focus in IOHK for 2020 is to develop and expand our education materials as we transition fully into the Shelley era and then to the Goguen era of Cardano.\n\nThe IOHK education team will be investing significant time and effort this year in broadening our range of materials. We aim to enhance understanding of our technologies using a variety of learning and training assets targeted at a wide range of stakeholder audiences, both internal and external. This will be vital as the use of IOHK technology moves into the mainstream. We also aim to provide knowledge and information to enterprise decision-makers so they know what business problems our technologies can solve. We have lots planned and many projects are underway as we grow Cardano into a global social and financial operating system.\n\n## What can you expect?\n\nWe started 2020 with lectures, by Dr Lars Br\u00fcnjes, our director of education, at the University of Malta. The focus of these lectures was on Plutus and Marlowe, our programming languages for smart contracts. The fruits of these sessions will, in turn, form the foundation of some modular training materials that we plan to formalize and develop over the coming months.\n\nOur free Udemy courses on [Plutus](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/) and [Marlowe](https://www.udemy.com/course/marlowe-programming-language/) by Alejandro Garcia have proven very popular, with over 5,000 students signed up. Feedback has been positive and, as a result of what we learned from our students, we\u2019ve been making incremental improvements over the last year. We now want to take this to the next level and are planning to fully update both courses soon to bring them up to speed with the latest development changes and new features. We are also in the initial planning stages for a second edition of the ebook, [Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts](https://leanpub.com/plutus-smart-contracts) by Lars Br\u00fcnjes and Polina Vinogradova, which we will be publishing later this year. The writing team has started to identify improvements and we are also gathering feedback directly from readers. If you have suggestions, please raise a pull request in our [Plutus ebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-book) with your ideas.\n\nAn important step in bridging the gap between our academic papers and mainstream understanding of these concepts is to teach people about Ouroboros, the proof-of-stake protocol that powers Cardano and ada. In response to the valuable feedback we have received from running the Incentivized Testnet, we are planning to create varied educational content to help stake pool operators understand Ouroboros and how the protocol works on a practical level.\n\n## Broadening our reach\n\nTo broaden the reach of our training courses and content, we are also investigating a way to migrate our popular Haskell training course into a massive online course, or MOOC, while also making it more comprehensive with the inclusion of Plutus and Marlowe material. In this way, we hope our MOOC will make the course even more valuable, and provide access to the widest possible global community. In addition, we are planning a comprehensive classroom-based Haskell and Plutus course in Mongolia, details of which will be finalized soon. We plan to use the introductory part of the online Haskell course as a primer for this face-to-face training. This is an example of a core efficiency that we are embracing where we aim to reuse content on Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe across a variety of stand-alone modular materials that we can use externally and within the company for developing our staff.\n\nWe appreciate the value of interactive and meaningful training workshops, so we intend to host many more this year in several locations around the world. These events are in the initial planning stages and the first in the series will take place in Quebec in the spring. We\u2019ll announce more details through our official channels \u2013 Twitter, email, here \u2013 nearer the time. The IOHK education team are on hand to support and prepare the necessary learning tools for participants to use at these events.\n\nAlongside these materials and courses, we are mentoring an undergraduate student at the International University of Management (ISM), with her thesis on the topic of the power of blockchain in emerging markets. Additionally, Dr Jamie Gabbay has been invited to contribute to the book '*Applications of new generation technology to cryptocurrencies, banking, and finance*\u2019 by Devraj Basu.\n\n## Internal initiatives\n\nWe are also working with our human resources team to build the IOHK Training Academy: a new learning portal for our internal teams to upskill and develop professionally. This new resource is part of our learning and development strategy that aims to improve employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We want to provide access to a library of assets so our staff can easily find exactly what they need. We will be developing tailored \u2018learning journeys\u2019 by function, ready-made content that will help people develop skills in new areas, as well as creating specific onboarding journeys for new starters. This is a vital resource for a fast-growing company with staff and contractors spread across 43 countries and will prove to be an important asset for all our people.\n\n2020 is going to be a pivotal year for Cardano and we are looking forward to playing our part. It is our aim to teach both individuals and organizations how to use the protocol, and how it can help with their everyday lives. We have lots to do and we look forward to sharing all the educational content that we produce with our existing community, as well as those of you who are new to Cardano.

These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways.

This week we have contacted everyone interested (over 2,000) to get a better idea of their experience and expertise. Those of you who have been selected for the first round of this program will hear from us very soon. If you don\u2019t receive an invitation at this stage, don\u2019t worry as we will be running several rounds of this program, so please do stay in touch!\n\n\r\n\r\n## Course structure ##\r\nThe first iteration of the new program starts next week.  The cohort joining this program will be true pioneers. As well as being part of a group that will have *early access* to a set of learning modules, your feedback will help us develop and iterate the overall learning experience.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe course will teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus. The course modules will cover the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including functions and data types, type classes, monads, template Haskell, using the [Plutus Playground](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/01/25/introducing-the-new-plutus-playground/), the [Extended UTXO model](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/), working with Plutus on and off the chain, minting policies, state machines, the Plutus application framework, as well as some case studies and practical exercises. \n\r\n\r\nThe course will follow a modular approach and will be highly interactive \u2013 each week we will be releasing new teaching videos from our director of education, Lars Br\u00fcnjes, along with a set of practical exercises to complete during the week as part of each module. We will also be holding regular Q&A sessions and you will have access to a dedicated community channel on Discord, created especially to help you to connect with other course participants as you learn. \r\n\r\nOutside the exercises and videos, students will be encouraged to learn at a pace that is right for them and to collaborate with fellow students. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week. These moderators are all graduates of the [Mongolia class of 2020](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/21/online-learning-with-haskell-the-mongolia-class-of-2020/) that completed the Haskell MOOC and are well placed to assist with questions and challenges. At the close of each week, Lars will engage directly with the group to resolve more complex technical questions and provide feedback on the subject matter covered that week. \r\n\r\n## Prior experience ##\r\nAs Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language), will be very helpful. At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts. We are also developing education programs for both [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/marlowe/marlowe-explainer.html) and [Glow](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), so don't feel like you have missed out if this Plutus course is not for you. We\u2019re still keen to have you onboard, so do watch this space for details of these other courses!\r\n\r\n## Certification ##\r\nWe will reward participants for their efforts in participating in this course and certify those pioneers that complete the entire program and are successful. These Plutus pioneer certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their knowledge and qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.\r\n \r\n## Ready to start ##\r\nWe are excited to have so many developers from our ecosystem on board and ready to get started and learn Plutus. You\u2019ll not only be learning yourselves, but acting as a pioneer to help us determine the best way to teach and deliver this course \u2013 truly helping pave the way for future cohorts who enroll!

IOHK has relaunched the Mantis project to mitigate against the recent attacks, provide enhanced security, and establish a robust means of interacting with the ETC chain. A commitment to fostering innovation and sustainability lies at the heart of the project. We are aiming to provide a steady funding income with the establishment of a proto-treasury to nurture future development and growth. This Mantis re-launch represents the culmination of a project that we've been working on for some time. Over the past few months, we have resurrected our code base, and gathered a dedicated Mantis team together who have worked hard to refine and improve the code and deliver important new features.\n\n## What\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Mantis\u00a0project?\n\nMantis is a project that is built for the community, specifically designed for the developers, wallet users, and infrastructure providers to enable direct interaction with the ETC blockchain. Essentially, it is a place where future development can evolve and be tested by the community. The Mantis release includes the following components:\n- Mantis client - a CLI tool that connects to other clients in a peer-to-peer manner to allow users to communicate with the ETC chain, send and receive transactions, sync the blockchain data, execute and validate smart contracts, and deploy new smart contracts on-chain.\r\n- Mantis wallet - a node wallet with incorporated graphical user interface (GUI), which connects to both mainnet and the Sagano and Mordor testnets. \r\n- Mantis faucet - enables developers to receive testnet funds for use on the Sagano and Mordor testnets.\r\n- Mantis explorer - allows tracking recent activities and transactions in regards to the ETC chain, covering the ETC mainnet, and Sagano and Mordor testnets. \n\nPlease visit the [Mantis website](https://mantisclient.io/) where you can download the latest version of both the Mantis client and wallet.\r\n\r\nMantis software implements the official Ethereum Classic specification and Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals [(ECIPs)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) introduced by ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem. The project has undergone a number of enhancements in terms of adding robustness and variety to the client offering, including optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term. It has been developed from the ground up and built in 100% Scala code, a functional programming language that offers security guarantees that other languages do not. Mantis features include stable peer discovery, pruning, fast synchronization, and newly implemented checkpointing (for 51% attack resistance) and proto-treasury (for long-term sustainability). Let\u2019s take a closer look at these features.\n\n## Checkpointing \r\n*Persistence* and *liveness* are two crucial properties that a transaction ledger should possess. It is a proven fact that both persistence and liveness suffer when the adversarial mining power in the proof of work surpasses 50%, and in the recent year, ETC has undergone several double-spending attacks prompted by the creation of large chain reorganizations. Considering that persistence and liveness were not guaranteed within the ETC network, we sought to implement protocol changes that will re-establish persistence and liveness under current network conditions, and *checkpointing* is one of the proposed solutions. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered, by using the *k* parameter, or depth parameter, where every *k* block gets irreversibly \"checkpointed\", meaning that no one can ever drop or revert it. A trusted authority can choose the block on which to issue a checkpoint, which means that they can decide which block becomes the canonical chain that all parties should follow. This trusted authority must run continuously and is responsible for publishing the checkpoint to the network. Checkpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered with regards to mining. The mining rewards are not affected and the checkpointing federation can only issue checkpoints on blocks that have valid proof of work and cannot mint blocks on its own. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing is now implemented within the Mantis project, and according to our recent [ECIP comparison for 51% attack resistance](https://static.iohk.io/docs/etc/ecip-comparison-for-51-attack-resistance.pdf), it provides far greater, and importantly formally proven, security against these types of attacks. It is important that any 51% attack mitigation is truly robust enough to give absolute certainty to ETC holders, users, and service providers that their transactions will be secure.\r\n\n## Proto-Treasury\r\nFor the longer-term health and success of the ETC ecosystem, we position network growth, sustainability, and innovation as key elements to ensure network security. With that in mind, we are implementing a proto-treasury system within the Mantis project to establish a steady funding income.  A well-developed governance strategy will enable effective, distributed funding for the long-term development of Mantis, whereas a decentralized treasury would ensure two important things for the future of the ecosystem:\r\n- Firstly, it would provide a permanent ongoing source of funding for the ETC network. while increasing the value of the ecosystem and promoting greater developer engagement. \r\n\r\n- Secondly, it would provide a distributed and transparent funding mechanism, which lets the ETC community determine its future growth and enable the sustainability required for innovation and growth.\r\n\r\nEstablishing the treasury for funding purposes ensures a clear vision of the substantial system maintenance focused to obtain innovation and diversity from other projects, including proof of stake (PoS) and newer blockchains. This solution is straightforward in its optimization for speed and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal foresees to distribute 80% of existing mining rewards to miners and 20% to the proto-treasury smart contract. The treasury will be controlled by the community and will enable a decentralized, collaborative decision-making process, offering an opt-in type collaboration for those who are interested.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\r\nAs much as we\u2019re excited about the Mantis relaunch, it should be stressed that its capability won\u2019t be limited to just the features outlined here. Mantis is an evolving project and right now we are establishing its foundational building blocks and running rigorous security audits. Further down the road, it will see more performance improvements in terms of CPU, GPU and ASICs compatibility, a new proof-of-work consensus protocol and algorithm introduction (PRISM consensus, Keccak256 algorithm) and, of course, additional enhancements for better interoperability and speed of transaction processing.

We also aim to provide knowledge and information to enterprise decision-makers so they know what business problems our technologies can solve. We have lots planned and many projects are underway as we grow Cardano into a global social and financial operating system.\n\n## What can you expect?\n\nWe started 2020 with lectures, by Dr Lars Br\u00fcnjes, our director of education, at the University of Malta. The focus of these lectures was on Plutus and Marlowe, our programming languages for smart contracts. The fruits of these sessions will, in turn, form the foundation of some modular training materials that we plan to formalize and develop over the coming months.\n\nOur free Udemy courses on [Plutus](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/) and [Marlowe](https://www.udemy.com/course/marlowe-programming-language/) by Alejandro Garcia have proven very popular, with over 5,000 students signed up. Feedback has been positive and, as a result of what we learned from our students, we\u2019ve been making incremental improvements over the last year. We now want to take this to the next level and are planning to fully update both courses soon to bring them up to speed with the latest development changes and new features. We are also in the initial planning stages for a second edition of the ebook, [Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts](https://leanpub.com/plutus-smart-contracts) by Lars Br\u00fcnjes and Polina Vinogradova, which we will be publishing later this year. The writing team has started to identify improvements and we are also gathering feedback directly from readers. If you have suggestions, please raise a pull request in our [Plutus ebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-book) with your ideas.\n\nAn important step in bridging the gap between our academic papers and mainstream understanding of these concepts is to teach people about Ouroboros, the proof-of-stake protocol that powers Cardano and ada. In response to the valuable feedback we have received from running the Incentivized Testnet, we are planning to create varied educational content to help stake pool operators understand Ouroboros and how the protocol works on a practical level.\n\n## Broadening our reach\n\nTo broaden the reach of our training courses and content, we are also investigating a way to migrate our popular Haskell training course into a massive online course, or MOOC, while also making it more comprehensive with the inclusion of Plutus and Marlowe material. In this way, we hope our MOOC will make the course even more valuable, and provide access to the widest possible global community. In addition, we are planning a comprehensive classroom-based Haskell and Plutus course in Mongolia, details of which will be finalized soon. We plan to use the introductory part of the online Haskell course as a primer for this face-to-face training. This is an example of a core efficiency that we are embracing where we aim to reuse content on Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe across a variety of stand-alone modular materials that we can use externally and within the company for developing our staff.\n\nWe appreciate the value of interactive and meaningful training workshops, so we intend to host many more this year in several locations around the world. These events are in the initial planning stages and the first in the series will take place in Quebec in the spring. We\u2019ll announce more details through our official channels \u2013 Twitter, email, here \u2013 nearer the time. The IOHK education team are on hand to support and prepare the necessary learning tools for participants to use at these events.\n\nAlongside these materials and courses, we are mentoring an undergraduate student at the International University of Management (ISM), with her thesis on the topic of the power of blockchain in emerging markets. Additionally, Dr Jamie Gabbay has been invited to contribute to the book '*Applications of new generation technology to cryptocurrencies, banking, and finance*\u2019 by Devraj Basu.\n\n## Internal initiatives\n\nWe are also working with our human resources team to build the IOHK Training Academy: a new learning portal for our internal teams to upskill and develop professionally. This new resource is part of our learning and development strategy that aims to improve employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We want to provide access to a library of assets so our staff can easily find exactly what they need. We will be developing tailored \u2018learning journeys\u2019 by function, ready-made content that will help people develop skills in new areas, as well as creating specific onboarding journeys for new starters. This is a vital resource for a fast-growing company with staff and contractors spread across 43 countries and will prove to be an important asset for all our people.\n\n2020 is going to be a pivotal year for Cardano and we are looking forward to playing our part. It is our aim to teach both individuals and organizations how to use the protocol, and how it can help with their everyday lives. We have lots to do and we look forward to sharing all the educational content that we produce with our existing community, as well as those of you who are new to Cardano.

These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2.

Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways.

Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using.

Cardano and the Nervos Network. Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the [Nervos website](https://www.nervos.org/) for more information on upcoming partnerships and research initiatives.*\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/06/02/nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano/", "read_time": 3}, {"publish_date": "2021-02-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/b32a85c3-d8e4-4756-8972-df0fe7be0062/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Bringing Glow to Cardano", "subtitle": " We just spun up a devnet to support Glow, the very latest language Cardano will support.

We caught up with Rideau (also known as Fare) to hear more about his vision for Glow and the Cardano journey so far. The following is a distillation of his thoughts from our previous interviews.*\n\n\n\n**We first introduced the community to GLOW and MuKn at the end of [last year](https://youtu.be/lj9SlvOIBgU?t=2902) when we announced our devnets approach \u2013\u00a0 but maybe you can remind us how you began working with IOHK?**\n\nI started as a researcher in formal methods for programming languages and distributed systems. But I wanted to build systems actually used by many, so I moved into the industry where I notably worked on proving the correctness of a centralized payment protocol and creating an airline reservation system. After a few years at Google and Bridgewater, I decided life wasn\u2019t worth working under dysfunctional hierarchies, so I started my own cryptocurrency companies. Charles invited me to speak at the IOHK Summit 2019, and I realized how much I like the Cardano community: we have a similar focus on building robust software for the long term. That is why I wanted to port my domain specific language Glow to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Tell us a bit why you started your company Mutual Knowledge Systems, or as you call it MuKn (Moon)?**\n\nOver three years ago, I was reviewing whitepapers. Most papers (about \u00be) had interesting techniques but made no economic sense. Most of the rest (about \u2155) made economic sense but had no technical content. Only the top few (about 5%) actually made sense both technically and economically. At some point, I realized I could do better, so I designed a scaling solution using lessons learned from working on Tezos. Arthur Breitman challenged me to use smart contracts instead of trying to modify his protocol. \n\nWhile trying to prove his challenge absurd, I instead found that he was right and I was wrong\u2014and I finally understood why and how to use smart contracts. I started a company around the resulting scaling solution, raised money, pivoted into building the scaling solution after the language capable of generating it from specification, fought with and fired my then-partner, became my own CEO, started a new company, and, after much struggle, finally found the right founding team. Together, we built Mutual Knowledge Systems around this new programming language, Glow\u2014designed to be much better than existing languages to write decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n**When you say \u2018better\u2019, what do you really mean?**\n\nWriting a DApp is the single hardest thing to do in the world. This is because you can\u2019t afford a mistake, or your users may lose significant funds. Furthermore, you are not confronting random situations, but active adversaries bent on attacking your code, who will contrive the very worst case scenarios to exploit for their profit. Yet, unlike the military, you can\u2019t hide your code or protect access to your networks: all the critical pieces are necessarily public. On top of that, extant programming tools are not designed for these constraints and even traditional formal methods lack essential concepts to express the issues at stake.\n\nThus, we decided to make new tools fit for the challenge. Our domain-specific language (DSL) drastically simplifies DApp development, by abstracting away all the common blockchain infrastructure, so you can focus on your problem domain (trading, derivatives, insurance, supply chain, etc.). Your DApps can be thousands of lines of code that your users can afford to audit, instead of millions of lines of code that require leaps of blind faith. And the programming model will enable developers, auditors and automated verification tools to reason at the level of abstraction of participants exchanging assets, rather than at that of packets of bytes shipped around the Internet.\n\n\n\n**What is it about Cardano and its community that appeals?**\n\nI started like everyone else, on Ethereum, because its ecosystem is already mature. However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s got great fundamentals.\n\n\n\n**Can you talk about how you hope Glow will change the DApp developer experience?**\n\nGlow is portable. Today it works on Cardano and Ethereum but in the future it will work with any blockchain that is sufficiently advanced to support smart contracts. That means that you can write your DApp once and it will run on whichever platform has the users and the liquidity you seek. You don\u2019t have to make a guess about where liquidity will be in the future then sink heavy investments to develop on a single chain that you bet your house on.\n\n\n\nWith Glow, developers can run their DApps on all blockchains. Glow will commoditize blockchains. Blockchains will then compete on technical and economic merits, not on user lock-in and inertia. And the value brought to users will increase.\n\n\n\n**What can the community expect from Glow?**\n\nWe have launched this early version of Glow on the Cardano EVM Devnet with a command-line interface. In many ways, it is not yet ready for use by end-users, but it can already demonstrate simple applications. Users can also see how they may write a 6 line application in Glow that would require hundreds of lines in a combination of Solidity and JavaScript. We have a roadmap over the next few months to add a lot of features: from ERC20 tokens (and, on Cardano, native tokens), to generalized state channels, to a web interface, to a more robust runtime, etc. Eventually, we want to become the development environment for all blockchain projects. And Glow is of course an open source software open to the community.\n\n**We\u2019re rolling out the integration with Glow with our EVM and devnet program, so what are some of the benefits of this?**\n\nThe Cardano EVM side-chain will enable arbitrary contracts to run on Cardano that use the mature EVM platform, without waiting for Plutus to deliver its promise, to achieve feature-parity, to be considered stable, etc. And Glow can run on this EVM side-chain and provide the simplicity, safety and portability in DApp development that were not available before.\n\n**What is the rollout process like and how can our community get involved if they want to?**\n\nGlow is still in development. There are some things that it can do already and some it can\u2019t do yet. We invite DApp developers to join the Glow community and use the language for what it can already do, and otherwise help us build the blockchain development environment of the future. You can build the missing features you need yourself, or contract MuKn to build them for you. Even if you can\u2019t code and have no budget, you can help write the documentation, or even just tell us where it isn\u2019t clear yet, or what features you need most so we know what to prioritize. Together, we can build great DApps that you just couldn\u2019t have achieved safely and within budget with previous tools.\n\n*If you\u2019re a developer, we encourage you to get involved with [Mutual Knowledge Systems and Glow](https://mukn.io/).

However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s got great fundamentals.\n\n\n\n**Can you talk about how you hope Glow will change the DApp developer experience?**\n\nGlow is portable. Today it works on Cardano and Ethereum but in the future it will work with any blockchain that is sufficiently advanced to support smart contracts. That means that you can write your DApp once and it will run on whichever platform has the users and the liquidity you seek. You don\u2019t have to make a guess about where liquidity will be in the future then sink heavy investments to develop on a single chain that you bet your house on.\n\n\n\nWith Glow, developers can run their DApps on all blockchains. Glow will commoditize blockchains. Blockchains will then compete on technical and economic merits, not on user lock-in and inertia. And the value brought to users will increase.\n\n\n\n**What can the community expect from Glow?**\n\nWe have launched this early version of Glow on the Cardano EVM Devnet with a command-line interface. In many ways, it is not yet ready for use by end-users, but it can already demonstrate simple applications. Users can also see how they may write a 6 line application in Glow that would require hundreds of lines in a combination of Solidity and JavaScript. We have a roadmap over the next few months to add a lot of features: from ERC20 tokens (and, on Cardano, native tokens), to generalized state channels, to a web interface, to a more robust runtime, etc. Eventually, we want to become the development environment for all blockchain projects. And Glow is of course an open source software open to the community.\n\n**We\u2019re rolling out the integration with Glow with our EVM and devnet program, so what are some of the benefits of this?**\n\nThe Cardano EVM side-chain will enable arbitrary contracts to run on Cardano that use the mature EVM platform, without waiting for Plutus to deliver its promise, to achieve feature-parity, to be considered stable, etc. And Glow can run on this EVM side-chain and provide the simplicity, safety and portability in DApp development that were not available before.\n\n**What is the rollout process like and how can our community get involved if they want to?**\n\nGlow is still in development. There are some things that it can do already and some it can\u2019t do yet. We invite DApp developers to join the Glow community and use the language for what it can already do, and otherwise help us build the blockchain development environment of the future. You can build the missing features you need yourself, or contract MuKn to build them for you. Even if you can\u2019t code and have no budget, you can help write the documentation, or even just tell us where it isn\u2019t clear yet, or what features you need most so we know what to prioritize. Together, we can build great DApps that you just couldn\u2019t have achieved safely and within budget with previous tools.\n\n*If you\u2019re a developer, we encourage you to get involved with [Mutual Knowledge Systems and Glow](https://mukn.io/).

In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Decentralizing social media: a conversation with Ben Goertzel and Charles Hoskinson", "subtitle": "The minds behind SingularityNET and Cardano come together to explore a vision of the future of decentralization, AI, and social media.", "audio": null, "soundcloud": null, "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\n*At the end of 2020, we announced our collaboration with SingularityNET, in an exclusive [fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3O5F_CCT8c) between Charles Hoskinson and SingularityNET founder & CEO, Ben Goertzel.*\u00a0\n\n*SingularityNET recently shared further information on the partnership when they announced their exciting [Phase Two initiative](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a),* [](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a) *which includes a shift from Ethereum to Cardano, to achieve new network functionalities and launching a Stream of New AGI-ADA Tokens.*\n\n*Last week, Charles and Ben sat down again together in a special [SingularityNET podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNWJGGc7ESI). In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms.

To encourage participation, IOHK is sponsoring a prize fund of ada worth $10,000 as well as ongoing support to bring the projects to fruition. Proposals will be judged by a panel of IOHK and UN employees. They will determine the winners based on an idea\u2019s technical prowess, scalability and social impact, as well as its financial and volunteer support. The winning ideas will be able to seek the advice of experts from both the UN and IOHK to ensure that they are implemented in the most impactful way.\n\nTo qualify for the scheme, entries must be open source and be created for use on the Cardano blockchain. Example code should be written in Marlowe, a domain specific language developed for financial contracts on Cardano. These do not need to be fully coded submissions. Instead they can be ideas which inspire anyone to get involved with blockchain technology and sustainable development. The proposal submission period opens on Saturday October 10th.

Every presentation, panel and guest speaker at this online event, has been chosen to represent the many faces of Cardano. From world-class foundational research to the latest advances in cryptographic development; from the passion and dedication of the wider community to some of the innovators who have created our world and are lighting the path to the future. The event is meant to honor the hard work and dedication of the Cardano community, developers and contributors, and the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe virtual summit, much like IOHK\u2019s 2019 Miami summit will include presentations from IOHK team members, special guest appearances by thought leaders and a keynote speech by IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson. We were proud to announce that our guest of honor is internet co-creator and lead internet evangelist for Google, Vint Cerf. As one of the lead architects of the internet Vint is uniquely positioned to give us insight into building world changing technology.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be joined by Caitlin Long of the Wyoming Blockchain Select Committee. The Wall Street professional turned crypto pioneer has been blazing the trail for adoption in the state of Wyoming. She will give us a look at the challenges and opportunities she has faced while pushing for wider adoption of decentralization. Our final special guest, Stephen Wolfram is the creator of the computational knowledge platform Wolfram Alpha and the CEO of Wolfram Research. Cardano shares his dedication to advancing technology through open source research and a commitment to academic excellence. Between each of these important discussions our colleagues at IOHK will take center stage.\n\n## Thought leadership\n\nIOHK\u2019s chief scientist, Aggelos Kiayias, and director of African operations John O\u2019Connor will talk about research and outreach in the Cardano Blockchain. Our panel entitled \u2018Haskell, then, now, and the future\u2019 will examine the impact the functional programming language has had and where it is heading. The virtual summit also serves as the launchpad for new advancements like \u2018Prism\u2019 our decentralized identity solution.

We will be discussing next steps for growing the Cardano community alongside oncoming blockchain regulations, governance, and opportunities. In combination, we hope the summit tracks will offer something for anyone interested in the future of Cardano, by the science and ideas that surround it, by the great minds making it all happen and by the incredible community that has brought us here and will take us forward.\n\nSessions will encompass the philosophical as well as the technical. Brian Behlendorf, the CEO of the Hyperledger Consortium will form part of a panel focused on the importance of open source development. IOHK recently [joined](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/11/why-we-are-joining-hyperledger/) the Hyperledger Consortium, to better exploit our common vision of a future made better through shared knowledge. Following on the philosophy track, artificial intelligence researcher, Ben Goertzel will speak on the intersection of AI and decentralized technology. We hope to announce more exciting sessions in the days leading up to the event. At the end of the day, building the next generation of technology means bringing the best minds of many fields into the same room, even if it\u2019s a virtual one.\n\n## Building community\n\nThe Cardano Virtual Summit 2020: Shelley Edition, won\u2019t be all work and no play. The Covid crisis has forced every conference online in past months. While we can\u2019t recreate the full physical conference experience in the virtual space, we\u2019re keen to provide some of the networking and downtime opportunities you might expect. So we\u2019ve added a virtual \u2018chill-out\u2019 zone, with guided meditations, a DJ set, and even an online calligraphy lesson/demonstration. Our virtual platform will allow attendees to enjoy the digital expo space through avatars. We\u2019ll even get the conversation flowing with a digital Shelley cocktail \u2018happy hour\u2019 between meetings.\n\nRecent events have made it difficult to meet in person but we see The Cardano Virtual Summit as an opportunity to invite everyone from around the world to participate. Attendance for anyone interested in the summit is absolutely free of charge. To join in, simply [reserve](https://www.ubivent.com/register/cardanovirtualsummit) your spot.\n\nShelley is the culmination of over 5 years of research and development, the creation of a multi-disciplinary team and a remarkable community. The virtual summit is just a single point of time \u2013 a time to take stock, reflect and celebrate.

Every presentation, panel and guest speaker at this online event, has been chosen to represent the many faces of Cardano. From world-class foundational research to the latest advances in cryptographic development; from the passion and dedication of the wider community to some of the innovators who have created our world and are lighting the path to the future. The event is meant to honor the hard work and dedication of the Cardano community, developers and contributors, and the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe virtual summit, much like IOHK\u2019s 2019 Miami summit will include presentations from IOHK team members, special guest appearances by thought leaders and a keynote speech by IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson. We were proud to announce that our guest of honor is internet co-creator and lead internet evangelist for Google, Vint Cerf. As one of the lead architects of the internet Vint is uniquely positioned to give us insight into building world changing technology.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be joined by Caitlin Long of the Wyoming Blockchain Select Committee. The Wall Street professional turned crypto pioneer has been blazing the trail for adoption in the state of Wyoming. She will give us a look at the challenges and opportunities she has faced while pushing for wider adoption of decentralization. Our final special guest, Stephen Wolfram is the creator of the computational knowledge platform Wolfram Alpha and the CEO of Wolfram Research. Cardano shares his dedication to advancing technology through open source research and a commitment to academic excellence.

He recently sat down for an interview to discuss the upcoming Byron reboot, the Haskell Shelley testnet, and the conclusion of the pre-Shelley development cycle. Coutts, who has been working with IOHK since 2016, brings a wealth of knowledge from working with the Haskell programming language for nearly 20 years and helping found the Well-Typed consultancy.\n\n**What\u2019s your role at IOHK?**\n\nI\u2019m the chief technical architect for the Cardano project and I\u2019m primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the node. This means that I collaborate with the teams that work on consensus, ledger, networking, and other things. Ultimately, I work to bring everyone together around the same design after a discussion with the team leaders. The design of Cardano is the product of joint work by many individuals working together.\n\n**What does the Haskell programming language bring to Cardano?**\n\nHaskell is an enabler. It makes it easier for us to follow the approach that we believe is right, which is driven by computer science. We know how to do things properly; computer science tells us how. We just need to pick the appropriate techniques to do that. Haskell makes that easier.\n\nIt\u2019s a good fit for Cardano because it suits the high-assurance, specification-driven software that is vital for a blockchain. Haskell helps us find systematic ways of avoiding mistakes. In essence, it\u2019s a better mousetrap.\n\n**You\u2019ve been working with Haskell for a long time. How have you seen the landscape of functional programming change?**\n\nPeople take it seriously now. When I started as an undergraduate in 1999, I thought that Haskell was amazing. Other students thought, \u2018Wow that\u2019s totally impractical. How will you ever get a job?\u2019\n\nAt the time, functional programming was an academic curiosity. There wasn\u2019t any prebuilt code and it wasn\u2019t machine readable, which meant that Haskell wasn\u2019t usable for a wide range of people. There wasn\u2019t the tooling, range of libraries, or experience. That has changed over the years: the tooling got better, the libraries got better. IOHK has helped develop the infrastructure for building and distributing open-source Haskell code and the number of libraries exploded. That, combined with more teaching and a gradual change of attitude in the industry, means that people take it more seriously now. Haskell hasn\u2019t changed as much as the industry around us has.\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest change from an industry point of view?**\n\nThere are two things. The first is that attitudes are changing, albeit slowly. People are changing their opinions about what they consider a sensible language choice. Previously, everything had to be in C or Java or maybe Python, but eventually good ideas make progress, even if it takes a long time. You can make a lot of progress by just recognizing that a good idea is a good idea. The mainstream does pick up on important developments, even if it does take 10 or 15 years. The industry has not embraced functional programming wholesale yet, but individual programmers have taken up various ideas. That makes Haskell look less radical.\n\nIf you look at a language like Rust, it has some of the clever type systems of Haskell, although it doesn\u2019t have any functional programming ideas. Even Java and C++ have some functional programming ideas in them these days, so Haskell is not quite so far from the mainstream as it used to be.\n\nThe second major change has been performance, which is getting much better. We\u2019ve recently become competitive with Java in terms of performance. It makes people say, \u2018Wow, Haskell is so fast,\u2019 but that\u2019s because they\u2019re comparing it to Python and PHP rather than C. So that\u2019s another way of saying that Haskell has improved slightly, but the industry environment around it has changed as well.\n\n**You have been heavily involved in the Byron reboot which was kicked off last week. Why was this work important?**\n\nThe [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/) is the culmination of over 18 months of hard work across multiple IOHK development teams, and constitutes a complete overhaul of the node infrastructure with 100% fresh code. The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself. The Byron reboot will go a long way to improving things, and users should see Daedalus syncing and restoring wallets within minutes, even when downloading the entire Cardano blockchain.\n\n**As the chief architect, your job is to lay the foundation for Cardano\u2019s future. What have you focused on to achieve this?**\n\nThe most important aspect in terms of flexibility for the future is keeping different functions separate. One of the big improvements of the Byron reboot is that the ledger rules will be totally independent of the consensus implementation; this modularity means that the ledger rules are perfectly clean mathematical functions, which is a core aspect of functional programming.\n\nAs a result, everything is easier to test, tweak, and change, both now and in the future. The consensus algorithm isn\u2019t entangled with the details of the ledger rules, so we can alter the ledger rules without changing the consensus implementation. This makes integrating Plutus and smart contracts functionality much easier and will also help in the future when we are adding treasury and governance features.\n\nThe consensus implementation itself has also been parameterized so that we can transition from the Ouroboros Classic consensus protocol to BFT and then Praos, which also provides flexibility for future versions of the protocol that haven't been developed yet.\n\n**Shelley is a big step towards the future of Cardano, but what is the significance of compiling Haskell into JavaScript and WebAssembly?**\n\nWe\u2019re interested in compiling to JavaScript or WebAssembly because of Plutus. We want to have Plutus contracts or Plutus applications that can be distributed to users, which would include custom interfaces and custom logic with the user rather than in a server. Compiling to JavaScript allows us to do that; you can compile the Plutus code once and distribute it to users on different platforms.\n\n- - -\n\nThanks to Duncan Coutts for his time. As chief technical architect, he\u2019s a cornerstone of the Cardano project and has been fundamental to the ongoing success of the platform.

The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself. The Byron reboot will go a long way to improving things, and users should see Daedalus syncing and restoring wallets within minutes, even when downloading the entire Cardano blockchain.\n\n**As the chief architect, your job is to lay the foundation for Cardano\u2019s future. What have you focused on to achieve this?**\n\nThe most important aspect in terms of flexibility for the future is keeping different functions separate. One of the big improvements of the Byron reboot is that the ledger rules will be totally independent of the consensus implementation; this modularity means that the ledger rules are perfectly clean mathematical functions, which is a core aspect of functional programming.\n\nAs a result, everything is easier to test, tweak, and change, both now and in the future. The consensus algorithm isn\u2019t entangled with the details of the ledger rules, so we can alter the ledger rules without changing the consensus implementation. This makes integrating Plutus and smart contracts functionality much easier and will also help in the future when we are adding treasury and governance features.\n\nThe consensus implementation itself has also been parameterized so that we can transition from the Ouroboros Classic consensus protocol to BFT and then Praos, which also provides flexibility for future versions of the protocol that haven't been developed yet.\n\n**Shelley is a big step towards the future of Cardano, but what is the significance of compiling Haskell into JavaScript and WebAssembly?**\n\nWe\u2019re interested in compiling to JavaScript or WebAssembly because of Plutus. We want to have Plutus contracts or Plutus applications that can be distributed to users, which would include custom interfaces and custom logic with the user rather than in a server. Compiling to JavaScript allows us to do that; you can compile the Plutus code once and distribute it to users on different platforms.\n\n- - -\n\nThanks to Duncan Coutts for his time. As chief technical architect, he\u2019s a cornerstone of the Cardano project and has been fundamental to the ongoing success of the platform.

The first answer to a problem is rarely the best, and any enterprise-focused solution cannot be gated by complexity or threaten network security.\n\n## Bringing functional programming to smart contracts with Plutus\n\nWe\u2019re big fans of functional programming here at IOHK and are proud to be able to say that the code underpinning the Cardano network is written in Haskell, the world\u2019s foremost functional programming language. Plutus is no different. Compared to their object-oriented counterparts, functional programming languages are less prone to ambiguity and human error \u2013 always a good thing \u2013 as well as being easier to verify and test. By using Plutus to write smart contracts on the Cardano network, developers benefit from all of the above, as well as the ability to use the same language for both on and off-chain code.\n\nWhile developers will have to wait for the Goguen era to launch smart contracts on the Cardano network, they can begin testing their smart contract skills in the [Plutus Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/plutus/tools/playground/ \"Plutus Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"). IOHK has also created a [Plutus ebook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plutus-Writing-reliable-smart-contracts-ebook/dp/B07V46LWTW \"Plutus ebook, amazon.com\") and [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/ \"Plutus Udemy course, udemy.com\") to help developers hit the ground running once Plutus is available on the Cardano mainnet.\n\n## And bringing Plutus to everyone with Marlowe\n\nThe problem with smart contracts, however, is that sometimes the people who know how to write the code don\u2019t have the industry expertise to know how to structure the contracts themselves. Enter Marlowe, IOHK\u2019s domain-specific language (DSL). Marlowe is designed for use by anyone that wants to write a financial smart contract without the programming skills to implement it. Users can try out Marlowe via the [Marlowe Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/marlowe/get-started/sample-marlowe-smart-contracts/ \"Marlowe Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"), a web utility with a user-friendly GUI and drag and drop components, where they can create financial smart contracts which, when complete, will generate fully-functional, implementation-ready Plutus code.\n\nMarlowe gives anyone the ability to gain familiarity with smart contracts while protecting them from unexpected outcomes. It also protects the developer and the system by ensuring that ill-formed smart contracts cannot be run. Finally, Marlowe focuses on commitment-of-funds and time-outs. These make certain that both parties have dedicated funds in the agreement while ensuring that money will not be left in the system after a contract has concluded.\n\n## Laying solid foundations\n\nPlutus, Marlowe, and the Cardano ecosystem continue to evolve to provide the safest and most efficient conditions to build decentralized applications. The next generations of Plutus and Marlowe will be announced at the WyoHackathon at the University of Wyoming on September 20, ahead of their release on mainnet at the start of the Goguen era. Marlowe advances include a high-fidelity development system that aids the writing of executable contracts and the new iteration of Plutus will allow users to access their contracts from web or mobile applications.

Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

This week, building on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://developers.cardano.org/en/virtual-machines/welcome/), we\u2019re rolling out a new [development environment](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/) to support the Glow language.*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau of Mutual Knowledge Systems is the creator of Glow, a DSL that will allow anyone to write verifiable DApps from a single spec and deploy it on our EVM network. We caught up with Rideau (also known as Fare) to hear more about his vision for Glow and the Cardano journey so far. The following is a distillation of his thoughts from our previous interviews.*\n\n\n\n**We first introduced the community to GLOW and MuKn at the end of [last year](https://youtu.be/lj9SlvOIBgU?t=2902) when we announced our devnets approach \u2013\u00a0 but maybe you can remind us how you began working with IOHK?**\n\nI started as a researcher in formal methods for programming languages and distributed systems. But I wanted to build systems actually used by many, so I moved into the industry where I notably worked on proving the correctness of a centralized payment protocol and creating an airline reservation system. After a few years at Google and Bridgewater, I decided life wasn\u2019t worth working under dysfunctional hierarchies, so I started my own cryptocurrency companies. Charles invited me to speak at the IOHK Summit 2019, and I realized how much I like the Cardano community: we have a similar focus on building robust software for the long term. That is why I wanted to port my domain specific language Glow to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Tell us a bit why you started your company Mutual Knowledge Systems, or as you call it MuKn (Moon)?**\n\nOver three years ago, I was reviewing whitepapers. Most papers (about \u00be) had interesting techniques but made no economic sense. Most of the rest (about \u2155) made economic sense but had no technical content. Only the top few (about 5%) actually made sense both technically and economically. At some point, I realized I could do better, so I designed a scaling solution using lessons learned from working on Tezos. Arthur Breitman challenged me to use smart contracts instead of trying to modify his protocol. \n\nWhile trying to prove his challenge absurd, I instead found that he was right and I was wrong\u2014and I finally understood why and how to use smart contracts. I started a company around the resulting scaling solution, raised money, pivoted into building the scaling solution after the language capable of generating it from specification, fought with and fired my then-partner, became my own CEO, started a new company, and, after much struggle, finally found the right founding team. Together, we built Mutual Knowledge Systems around this new programming language, Glow\u2014designed to be much better than existing languages to write decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n**When you say \u2018better\u2019, what do you really mean?**\n\nWriting a DApp is the single hardest thing to do in the world. This is because you can\u2019t afford a mistake, or your users may lose significant funds. Furthermore, you are not confronting random situations, but active adversaries bent on attacking your code, who will contrive the very worst case scenarios to exploit for their profit. Yet, unlike the military, you can\u2019t hide your code or protect access to your networks: all the critical pieces are necessarily public. On top of that, extant programming tools are not designed for these constraints and even traditional formal methods lack essential concepts to express the issues at stake.\n\nThus, we decided to make new tools fit for the challenge. Our domain-specific language (DSL) drastically simplifies DApp development, by abstracting away all the common blockchain infrastructure, so you can focus on your problem domain (trading, derivatives, insurance, supply chain, etc.). Your DApps can be thousands of lines of code that your users can afford to audit, instead of millions of lines of code that require leaps of blind faith. And the programming model will enable developers, auditors and automated verification tools to reason at the level of abstraction of participants exchanging assets, rather than at that of packets of bytes shipped around the Internet.\n\n\n\n**What is it about Cardano and its community that appeals?**\n\nI started like everyone else, on Ethereum, because its ecosystem is already mature. However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s got great fundamentals.\n\n\n\n**Can you talk about how you hope Glow will change the DApp developer experience?**\n\nGlow is portable. Today it works on Cardano and Ethereum but in the future it will work with any blockchain that is sufficiently advanced to support smart contracts. That means that you can write your DApp once and it will run on whichever platform has the users and the liquidity you seek. You don\u2019t have to make a guess about where liquidity will be in the future then sink heavy investments to develop on a single chain that you bet your house on.\n\n\n\nWith Glow, developers can run their DApps on all blockchains. Glow will commoditize blockchains. Blockchains will then compete on technical and economic merits, not on user lock-in and inertia. And the value brought to users will increase.\n\n\n\n**What can the community expect from Glow?**\n\nWe have launched this early version of Glow on the Cardano EVM Devnet with a command-line interface. In many ways, it is not yet ready for use by end-users, but it can already demonstrate simple applications. Users can also see how they may write a 6 line application in Glow that would require hundreds of lines in a combination of Solidity and JavaScript. We have a roadmap over the next few months to add a lot of features: from ERC20 tokens (and, on Cardano, native tokens), to generalized state channels, to a web interface, to a more robust runtime, etc. Eventually, we want to become the development environment for all blockchain projects. And Glow is of course an open source software open to the community.\n\n**We\u2019re rolling out the integration with Glow with our EVM and devnet program, so what are some of the benefits of this?**\n\nThe Cardano EVM side-chain will enable arbitrary contracts to run on Cardano that use the mature EVM platform, without waiting for Plutus to deliver its promise, to achieve feature-parity, to be considered stable, etc. And Glow can run on this EVM side-chain and provide the simplicity, safety and portability in DApp development that were not available before.\n\n**What is the rollout process like and how can our community get involved if they want to?**\n\nGlow is still in development. There are some things that it can do already and some it can\u2019t do yet. We invite DApp developers to join the Glow community and use the language for what it can already do, and otherwise help us build the blockchain development environment of the future. You can build the missing features you need yourself, or contract MuKn to build them for you. Even if you can\u2019t code and have no budget, you can help write the documentation, or even just tell us where it isn\u2019t clear yet, or what features you need most so we know what to prioritize. Together, we can build great DApps that you just couldn\u2019t have achieved safely and within budget with previous tools.\n\n*If you\u2019re a developer, we encourage you to get involved with [Mutual Knowledge Systems and Glow](https://mukn.io/).

This week, building on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://developers.cardano.org/en/virtual-machines/welcome/), we\u2019re rolling out a new [development environment](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/) to support the Glow language.*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau of Mutual Knowledge Systems is the creator of Glow, a DSL that will allow anyone to write verifiable DApps from a single spec and deploy it on our EVM network. We caught up with Rideau (also known as Fare) to hear more about his vision for Glow and the Cardano journey so far. The following is a distillation of his thoughts from our previous interviews.*\n\n\n\n**We first introduced the community to GLOW and MuKn at the end of [last year](https://youtu.be/lj9SlvOIBgU?t=2902) when we announced our devnets approach \u2013\u00a0 but maybe you can remind us how you began working with IOHK?**\n\nI started as a researcher in formal methods for programming languages and distributed systems. But I wanted to build systems actually used by many, so I moved into the industry where I notably worked on proving the correctness of a centralized payment protocol and creating an airline reservation system. After a few years at Google and Bridgewater, I decided life wasn\u2019t worth working under dysfunctional hierarchies, so I started my own cryptocurrency companies. Charles invited me to speak at the IOHK Summit 2019, and I realized how much I like the Cardano community: we have a similar focus on building robust software for the long term. That is why I wanted to port my domain specific language Glow to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Tell us a bit why you started your company Mutual Knowledge Systems, or as you call it MuKn (Moon)?**\n\nOver three years ago, I was reviewing whitepapers. Most papers (about \u00be) had interesting techniques but made no economic sense. Most of the rest (about \u2155) made economic sense but had no technical content. Only the top few (about 5%) actually made sense both technically and economically. At some point, I realized I could do better, so I designed a scaling solution using lessons learned from working on Tezos. Arthur Breitman challenged me to use smart contracts instead of trying to modify his protocol. \n\nWhile trying to prove his challenge absurd, I instead found that he was right and I was wrong\u2014and I finally understood why and how to use smart contracts. I started a company around the resulting scaling solution, raised money, pivoted into building the scaling solution after the language capable of generating it from specification, fought with and fired my then-partner, became my own CEO, started a new company, and, after much struggle, finally found the right founding team. Together, we built Mutual Knowledge Systems around this new programming language, Glow\u2014designed to be much better than existing languages to write decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n**When you say \u2018better\u2019, what do you really mean?**\n\nWriting a DApp is the single hardest thing to do in the world. This is because you can\u2019t afford a mistake, or your users may lose significant funds. Furthermore, you are not confronting random situations, but active adversaries bent on attacking your code, who will contrive the very worst case scenarios to exploit for their profit. Yet, unlike the military, you can\u2019t hide your code or protect access to your networks: all the critical pieces are necessarily public. On top of that, extant programming tools are not designed for these constraints and even traditional formal methods lack essential concepts to express the issues at stake.\n\nThus, we decided to make new tools fit for the challenge. Our domain-specific language (DSL) drastically simplifies DApp development, by abstracting away all the common blockchain infrastructure, so you can focus on your problem domain (trading, derivatives, insurance, supply chain, etc.). Your DApps can be thousands of lines of code that your users can afford to audit, instead of millions of lines of code that require leaps of blind faith. And the programming model will enable developers, auditors and automated verification tools to reason at the level of abstraction of participants exchanging assets, rather than at that of packets of bytes shipped around the Internet.\n\n\n\n**What is it about Cardano and its community that appeals?**\n\nI started like everyone else, on Ethereum, because its ecosystem is already mature. However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not.

In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Decentralizing social media: a conversation with Ben Goertzel and Charles Hoskinson", "subtitle": "The minds behind SingularityNET and Cardano come together to explore a vision of the future of decentralization, AI, and social media.", "audio": null, "soundcloud": null, "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\n*At the end of 2020, we announced our collaboration with SingularityNET, in an exclusive [fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3O5F_CCT8c) between Charles Hoskinson and SingularityNET founder & CEO, Ben Goertzel.*\u00a0\n\n*SingularityNET recently shared further information on the partnership when they announced their exciting [Phase Two initiative](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a),* [](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a) *which includes a shift from Ethereum to Cardano, to achieve new network functionalities and launching a Stream of New AGI-ADA Tokens.*\n\n*Last week, Charles and Ben sat down again together in a special [SingularityNET podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNWJGGc7ESI). In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "decentralizing-social-media", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/02/05/decentralizing-social-media/", "read_time": 57}, {"publish_date": "2021-01-06T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/344fa779-3928-4439-870f-7977abbfec51/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": " Project Catalyst blasts off into 2021 ", "subtitle": "New fund will commit $500k in ada to find groundbreaking ideas which accelerate Cardano development", "audio": "", "soundcloud": [{"trackid": 987296944}], "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\nProject Catalyst is the first stage in our Voltaire roadmap, created to bring best-in-class governance to Cardano.

But it\u2019s not one that we can accomplish alone. That\u2019s why we are always on the lookout for relationships which help us build a global foundation for growth. So, we\u2019re thrilled to announce our hackathon challenge to support the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals (SDGs) designed to accelerate progress on fighting hunger, injustice, and climate change.\n\n## Sustainability and blockchain\n\nIn this hackathon challenge we aim to give the blockchain community an opportunity to make an impact on international development. The challenge will draw on IOHK\u2019s expertise in community-focused funding developed with Project Catalyst. This initiative brings innovation, voting, and decentralized funding to Cardano by crowdsourcing development proposals, and financing their implementation.\n\nIOHK and United Nations personnel will use the Project Catalyst platform to find and fund initiatives that align with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. These goals were adopted by 193 world leaders in 2015. Each of the 17 targets focus on ending extreme poverty and hunger, fighting inequality and injustice, and tackling climate change by 2030.\n\nThis IOHK-sponsored challenge hopes to promote projects based in the digitization of finance which increase the efficacy and transparency of funding for the UN\u2019s Decade of Action. In the run-up to the 2030 deadline for achieving the global sustainability goals, the UN is marking 75 years since its establishment. Given that the transnational organization works on global collective action problems it has engaged with blockchain technology as a solution.\n\n## Crowdsourcing the future\n\nParticipants in the program can put forward ideas focused on any of the 17 goals. To encourage participation, IOHK is sponsoring a prize fund of ada worth $10,000 as well as ongoing support to bring the projects to fruition. Proposals will be judged by a panel of IOHK and UN employees. They will determine the winners based on an idea\u2019s technical prowess, scalability and social impact, as well as its financial and volunteer support. The winning ideas will be able to seek the advice of experts from both the UN and IOHK to ensure that they are implemented in the most impactful way.\n\nTo qualify for the scheme, entries must be open source and be created for use on the Cardano blockchain. Example code should be written in Marlowe, a domain specific language developed for financial contracts on Cardano. These do not need to be fully coded submissions. Instead they can be ideas which inspire anyone to get involved with blockchain technology and sustainable development. The proposal submission period opens on Saturday October 10th. Participants must be registered by then in order to submit. Entries must be finalized by October 18 at 11:59 MDT.

But it\u2019s not one that we can accomplish alone. That\u2019s why we are always on the lookout for relationships which help us build a global foundation for growth. So, we\u2019re thrilled to announce our hackathon challenge to support the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals (SDGs) designed to accelerate progress on fighting hunger, injustice, and climate change.\n\n## Sustainability and blockchain\n\nIn this hackathon challenge we aim to give the blockchain community an opportunity to make an impact on international development. The challenge will draw on IOHK\u2019s expertise in community-focused funding developed with Project Catalyst. This initiative brings innovation, voting, and decentralized funding to Cardano by crowdsourcing development proposals, and financing their implementation.\n\nIOHK and United Nations personnel will use the Project Catalyst platform to find and fund initiatives that align with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. These goals were adopted by 193 world leaders in 2015. Each of the 17 targets focus on ending extreme poverty and hunger, fighting inequality and injustice, and tackling climate change by 2030.\n\nThis IOHK-sponsored challenge hopes to promote projects based in the digitization of finance which increase the efficacy and transparency of funding for the UN\u2019s Decade of Action. In the run-up to the 2030 deadline for achieving the global sustainability goals, the UN is marking 75 years since its establishment. Given that the transnational organization works on global collective action problems it has engaged with blockchain technology as a solution.\n\n## Crowdsourcing the future\n\nParticipants in the program can put forward ideas focused on any of the 17 goals. To encourage participation, IOHK is sponsoring a prize fund of ada worth $10,000 as well as ongoing support to bring the projects to fruition. Proposals will be judged by a panel of IOHK and UN employees. They will determine the winners based on an idea\u2019s technical prowess, scalability and social impact, as well as its financial and volunteer support. The winning ideas will be able to seek the advice of experts from both the UN and IOHK to ensure that they are implemented in the most impactful way.\n\nTo qualify for the scheme, entries must be open source and be created for use on the Cardano blockchain. Example code should be written in Marlowe, a domain specific language developed for financial contracts on Cardano. These do not need to be fully coded submissions. Instead they can be ideas which inspire anyone to get involved with blockchain technology and sustainable development. The proposal submission period opens on Saturday October 10th. Participants must be registered by then in order to submit. Entries must be finalized by October 18 at 11:59 MDT.

Whatever the pace and cadence of future rollouts, we wanted to develop a consistent method by which all updates to the core node could be easily adopted by everyone.\n\nIn order to make that integration and interaction with Cardano easier and faster, IOHK engineers formed the Adrestia team, to take responsibility for building all the web APIs and libraries that make Cardano accessible to developers and application builders.

Exchanges or third-party wallets using Cardano-SL, should now be integrating to prepare for the new Byron and upgrading to Shelley wallet. These need to happen consecutively to avoid any outages.

Long time supporters of IOHK are likely familiar with his signature long hair, beard, and penchant for drinking tea while discussing decentralization in front of a [white board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZGVgNsJSnA&t=572s). He recently sat down for an interview to discuss the upcoming Byron reboot, the Haskell Shelley testnet, and the conclusion of the pre-Shelley development cycle. Coutts, who has been working with IOHK since 2016, brings a wealth of knowledge from working with the Haskell programming language for nearly 20 years and helping found the Well-Typed consultancy.\n\n**What\u2019s your role at IOHK?**\n\nI\u2019m the chief technical architect for the Cardano project and I\u2019m primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the node. This means that I collaborate with the teams that work on consensus, ledger, networking, and other things. Ultimately, I work to bring everyone together around the same design after a discussion with the team leaders. The design of Cardano is the product of joint work by many individuals working together.\n\n**What does the Haskell programming language bring to Cardano?**\n\nHaskell is an enabler. It makes it easier for us to follow the approach that we believe is right, which is driven by computer science. We know how to do things properly; computer science tells us how. We just need to pick the appropriate techniques to do that. Haskell makes that easier.\n\nIt\u2019s a good fit for Cardano because it suits the high-assurance, specification-driven software that is vital for a blockchain. Haskell helps us find systematic ways of avoiding mistakes. In essence, it\u2019s a better mousetrap.\n\n**You\u2019ve been working with Haskell for a long time. How have you seen the landscape of functional programming change?**\n\nPeople take it seriously now. When I started as an undergraduate in 1999, I thought that Haskell was amazing. Other students thought, \u2018Wow that\u2019s totally impractical. How will you ever get a job?\u2019\n\nAt the time, functional programming was an academic curiosity. There wasn\u2019t any prebuilt code and it wasn\u2019t machine readable, which meant that Haskell wasn\u2019t usable for a wide range of people. There wasn\u2019t the tooling, range of libraries, or experience. That has changed over the years: the tooling got better, the libraries got better. IOHK has helped develop the infrastructure for building and distributing open-source Haskell code and the number of libraries exploded. That, combined with more teaching and a gradual change of attitude in the industry, means that people take it more seriously now. Haskell hasn\u2019t changed as much as the industry around us has.\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest change from an industry point of view?**\n\nThere are two things. The first is that attitudes are changing, albeit slowly. People are changing their opinions about what they consider a sensible language choice. Previously, everything had to be in C or Java or maybe Python, but eventually good ideas make progress, even if it takes a long time. You can make a lot of progress by just recognizing that a good idea is a good idea. The mainstream does pick up on important developments, even if it does take 10 or 15 years. The industry has not embraced functional programming wholesale yet, but individual programmers have taken up various ideas. That makes Haskell look less radical.\n\nIf you look at a language like Rust, it has some of the clever type systems of Haskell, although it doesn\u2019t have any functional programming ideas. Even Java and C++ have some functional programming ideas in them these days, so Haskell is not quite so far from the mainstream as it used to be.\n\nThe second major change has been performance, which is getting much better. We\u2019ve recently become competitive with Java in terms of performance. It makes people say, \u2018Wow, Haskell is so fast,\u2019 but that\u2019s because they\u2019re comparing it to Python and PHP rather than C. So that\u2019s another way of saying that Haskell has improved slightly, but the industry environment around it has changed as well.\n\n**You have been heavily involved in the Byron reboot which was kicked off last week. Why was this work important?**\n\nThe [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/) is the culmination of over 18 months of hard work across multiple IOHK development teams, and constitutes a complete overhaul of the node infrastructure with 100% fresh code. The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself.

Long time supporters of IOHK are likely familiar with his signature long hair, beard, and penchant for drinking tea while discussing decentralization in front of a [white board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZGVgNsJSnA&t=572s). He recently sat down for an interview to discuss the upcoming Byron reboot, the Haskell Shelley testnet, and the conclusion of the pre-Shelley development cycle. Coutts, who has been working with IOHK since 2016, brings a wealth of knowledge from working with the Haskell programming language for nearly 20 years and helping found the Well-Typed consultancy.\n\n**What\u2019s your role at IOHK?**\n\nI\u2019m the chief technical architect for the Cardano project and I\u2019m primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the node. This means that I collaborate with the teams that work on consensus, ledger, networking, and other things. Ultimately, I work to bring everyone together around the same design after a discussion with the team leaders. The design of Cardano is the product of joint work by many individuals working together.\n\n**What does the Haskell programming language bring to Cardano?**\n\nHaskell is an enabler. It makes it easier for us to follow the approach that we believe is right, which is driven by computer science. We know how to do things properly; computer science tells us how. We just need to pick the appropriate techniques to do that. Haskell makes that easier.\n\nIt\u2019s a good fit for Cardano because it suits the high-assurance, specification-driven software that is vital for a blockchain. Haskell helps us find systematic ways of avoiding mistakes. In essence, it\u2019s a better mousetrap.\n\n**You\u2019ve been working with Haskell for a long time. How have you seen the landscape of functional programming change?**\n\nPeople take it seriously now. When I started as an undergraduate in 1999, I thought that Haskell was amazing. Other students thought, \u2018Wow that\u2019s totally impractical. How will you ever get a job?\u2019\n\nAt the time, functional programming was an academic curiosity. There wasn\u2019t any prebuilt code and it wasn\u2019t machine readable, which meant that Haskell wasn\u2019t usable for a wide range of people. There wasn\u2019t the tooling, range of libraries, or experience. That has changed over the years: the tooling got better, the libraries got better. IOHK has helped develop the infrastructure for building and distributing open-source Haskell code and the number of libraries exploded. That, combined with more teaching and a gradual change of attitude in the industry, means that people take it more seriously now. Haskell hasn\u2019t changed as much as the industry around us has.\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest change from an industry point of view?**\n\nThere are two things. The first is that attitudes are changing, albeit slowly. People are changing their opinions about what they consider a sensible language choice. Previously, everything had to be in C or Java or maybe Python, but eventually good ideas make progress, even if it takes a long time. You can make a lot of progress by just recognizing that a good idea is a good idea. The mainstream does pick up on important developments, even if it does take 10 or 15 years. The industry has not embraced functional programming wholesale yet, but individual programmers have taken up various ideas. That makes Haskell look less radical.\n\nIf you look at a language like Rust, it has some of the clever type systems of Haskell, although it doesn\u2019t have any functional programming ideas. Even Java and C++ have some functional programming ideas in them these days, so Haskell is not quite so far from the mainstream as it used to be.\n\nThe second major change has been performance, which is getting much better. We\u2019ve recently become competitive with Java in terms of performance. It makes people say, \u2018Wow, Haskell is so fast,\u2019 but that\u2019s because they\u2019re comparing it to Python and PHP rather than C. So that\u2019s another way of saying that Haskell has improved slightly, but the industry environment around it has changed as well.\n\n**You have been heavily involved in the Byron reboot which was kicked off last week. Why was this work important?**\n\nThe [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/) is the culmination of over 18 months of hard work across multiple IOHK development teams, and constitutes a complete overhaul of the node infrastructure with 100% fresh code. The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself. The Byron reboot will go a long way to improving things, and users should see Daedalus syncing and restoring wallets within minutes, even when downloading the entire Cardano blockchain.\n\n**As the chief architect, your job is to lay the foundation for Cardano\u2019s future.

Plutus is no different. Compared to their object-oriented counterparts, functional programming languages are less prone to ambiguity and human error \u2013 always a good thing \u2013 as well as being easier to verify and test. By using Plutus to write smart contracts on the Cardano network, developers benefit from all of the above, as well as the ability to use the same language for both on and off-chain code.\n\nWhile developers will have to wait for the Goguen era to launch smart contracts on the Cardano network, they can begin testing their smart contract skills in the [Plutus Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/plutus/tools/playground/ \"Plutus Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"). IOHK has also created a [Plutus ebook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plutus-Writing-reliable-smart-contracts-ebook/dp/B07V46LWTW \"Plutus ebook, amazon.com\") and [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/ \"Plutus Udemy course, udemy.com\") to help developers hit the ground running once Plutus is available on the Cardano mainnet.\n\n## And bringing Plutus to everyone with Marlowe\n\nThe problem with smart contracts, however, is that sometimes the people who know how to write the code don\u2019t have the industry expertise to know how to structure the contracts themselves. Enter Marlowe, IOHK\u2019s domain-specific language (DSL). Marlowe is designed for use by anyone that wants to write a financial smart contract without the programming skills to implement it. Users can try out Marlowe via the [Marlowe Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/marlowe/get-started/sample-marlowe-smart-contracts/ \"Marlowe Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"), a web utility with a user-friendly GUI and drag and drop components, where they can create financial smart contracts which, when complete, will generate fully-functional, implementation-ready Plutus code.\n\nMarlowe gives anyone the ability to gain familiarity with smart contracts while protecting them from unexpected outcomes. It also protects the developer and the system by ensuring that ill-formed smart contracts cannot be run. Finally, Marlowe focuses on commitment-of-funds and time-outs. These make certain that both parties have dedicated funds in the agreement while ensuring that money will not be left in the system after a contract has concluded.\n\n## Laying solid foundations\n\nPlutus, Marlowe, and the Cardano ecosystem continue to evolve to provide the safest and most efficient conditions to build decentralized applications. The next generations of Plutus and Marlowe will be announced at the WyoHackathon at the University of Wyoming on September 20, ahead of their release on mainnet at the start of the Goguen era. Marlowe advances include a high-fidelity development system that aids the writing of executable contracts and the new iteration of Plutus will allow users to access their contracts from web or mobile applications.

Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

Cardano and the Nervos Network. Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the [Nervos website](https://www.nervos.org/) for more information on upcoming partnerships and research initiatives.*\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/06/02/nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano/", "read_time": 3}, {"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": {"title": "Shruti Appiah", "display_name": "", "thumbnail": "https://ucarecdn.com/4df5ffe0-0a4a-4003-89e2-eb9a499b5155/", "is_team_member": true, "is_active": true, "localized": [{"job_titles": [{"name": "Product Manager", "primary": true}, {"name": "Engineering", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrutiappiah/", "twitter": "", "github": "https://github.com/ShrutiAppiah"}}], "job_titles": [{"name": "Product Manager", "primary": true}, {"name": "Engineering", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrutiappiah/", "twitter": "", "github": "https://github.com/ShrutiAppiah"}, "profile_url": "/blog/authors/shruti-appiah/", "blog_posts": [{"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/84e114f9-431a-4539-8ede-c18b883446d7/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe

Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users.

Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe (starting June 3rd), you can [register on our website](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/) for these webinars now!*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/", "read_time": 6}, {"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/84e114f9-431a-4539-8ede-c18b883446d7/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

"Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe

execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe (starting June 3rd), you can [register on our website](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/) for these webinars now!*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/", "read_time": 6}], "total_pages": 44, "current_page": 4, "filters": {"2016": {"10": 4, "12": 1, "__total": 23, "09": 5, "08": 3, "07": 5, "05": 2, "01": 3}, "2017": {"10": 7, "11": 2, "12": 5, "__total": 43, "09": 3, "08": 4, "07": 3, "06": 2, "05": 2, "04": 2, "03": 6, "02": 6, "01": 1}, "2018": {"10": 4, "12": 5, "__total": 37, "09": 1, "08": 3, "07": 3, "06": 3, "05": 4, "04": 3, "03": 3, "02": 4, "01": 4}, "2019": {"10": 1, "11": 1, "12": 1, "__total": 24, "09": 4, "07": 4, "06": 2, "05": 2, "04": 4, "03": 1, "02": 2, "01": 2}, "2020": {"10": 6, "11": 7, "12": 11, "__total": 56, "09": 3, "08": 2, "07": 4, "06": 6, "05": 5, "04": 4, "03": 3, "02": 4, "01": 1}, "2021": {"__total": 35, "06": 2, "05": 6, "04": 8, "03": 7, "02": 7, "01": 5}}, "crumbs": [{"path": "/blog/posts/page-1/", "name": "blog_posts", "active": true}]}}}

Alonzo will establish the infrastructure and add tools for functional smart contract development using Plutus.\n\nThe Plutus platform provides a native smart contract language for the Cardano blockchain. To understand and become proficient in Plutus, one has to understand three concepts:\n\n* The *Extended UTXO model (EUTXO)*\n* *Plutus Core* \u2012 the \u2018on-chain\u2019 part of Plutus\n* *The Plutus Application Framework (PAF)* \u2012 the \u2018off-chain\u2019 part of Plutus that enables interaction with smart contracts.\n\nPlutus contracts consist of parts that run on the blockchain (on-chain code) and parts that run on a user\u2019s machine (off-chain or client code). Both the on-chain and off-chain code are written in Haskell, and Plutus smart contracts are effectively Haskell programs. Off-chain code can be written using PAF and this code is then compiled by the GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler), whereas on-chain code (written using the Plutus Core) is compiled by the Plutus compiler. \n\nIt is crucial to understand the relationship between these Plutus concepts and native tokens functionality to see how their interaction turns the latter into a more useful and powerful feature.\n\n## The Extended UTXO model\n\nCardano (like Bitcoin) uses the unspent (U) transaction (TX) output (O) accounting model. In the UTXO model, a *transaction* has *inputs* and *outputs*, where the **inputs** are unspent outputs from previous transactions. As soon as an output is used as input in a transaction, it becomes *spent* and can never be used again. The **output** is specified by an *address* (a public key or public key hash) and a *value* (consisting of an ada amount and optional, additional native token amounts). An output\u2019s address determines which transactions are allowed to \u2018unlock\u2019 the output and use it as an input. A transaction must be *signed* by the owner of the private key corresponding to the address. Think of an address as a \u2018lock\u2019 that can only be \u2018unlocked\u2019 by the right \u2018key\u2019 \u2012 the correct signature.\n\nThe EUTXO model *extends* this model in two directions: \n\n1. It generalizes the concept of \u2018address\u2019 by using the lock-and-key analogy. Instead of restricting locks to public keys and keys to signatures, addresses in the EUTXO model can contain arbitrary logic in the form of *scripts*. For example, when a node validates a transaction, the node determines whether or not the transaction is allowed to use a certain output as an input. The transaction will look up the script provided by the output's address and will execute the script if the transaction can use the output as an input.\n2. The second difference between UTXO and EUTXO is that outputs can carry (almost) arbitrary data in addition to an address and value. This makes scripts much more powerful by allowing them to carry *state*.\n\nWhen validating an address, the script will access the data being carried by the output, the transaction being validated, and some additional pieces of data called *redeemers*, which the transaction provides for every input. By looking up all this information, the script has enough context to give a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer in what can be highly complex situations and use cases.\n\nTo summarize, EUTXO extends the UTXO model by allowing output addresses to contain complex logic to decide which transactions can unlock them, and by adding *custom* data to *all* outputs.\n\nThe EUTXO model offers unique advantages over other accounting models. The success or failure of transaction validation depends only on the transaction itself and its inputs, and *not* on anything else on the blockchain. As a consequence, the validity of a transaction can be checked *off-chain*, before the transaction is sent to the blockchain. A transaction can still fail if some other transaction concurrently consumes an input that the transaction is expecting, but if all inputs are still present, the transaction is *guaranteed* to succeed.\n\nThis contrasts with an account-based model (as used by Ethereum), where a transaction can fail in mid-script execution. This can never happen in EUTXO. Also, transaction execution costs can be determined off-chain before transmission \u2013 another feature impossible on Ethereum.\n\nFinally, because of the \u2018local\u2019 nature of transaction validation, a high degree of parallelism is possible: a node could, in principle, validate transactions in parallel, if those transactions do not try to consume the same input. This is great both for efficiency and for reasoning, simplifying the analysis of possible outcomes, and proving that \u2018nothing bad\u2019 can happen. You can dive deeper into the [EUTXO model in the previous blog post](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/12/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model-part-2/).\n\n## Plutus Core\n\nTo implement the EUTXO model, it is necessary to clearly define the terms *script* and *data*. Scripts require a definite, well-specified scripting language, and it is also important to define the type of data that is attached to outputs and used as redeemers.\n\nThis is where *Plutus Core* comes in. Plutus Core is the scripting language used by Cardano. It is a simple functional language similar to Haskell, and a large subset of Haskell can be used to write Plutus Core scripts. As a contract author you don\u2019t write any Plutus Core. All Plutus Core programs are generated by a Haskell compiler plugin.\n\nThese scripts will be executed by nodes during transaction validation \u2018live\u2019 on the chain. They will either lock UTXOs in the form of *validator scripts* or as *minting policies*, which control the minting and burning of native tokens (see below).\n\nRedeemer data is a simple (algebraic) data type that can be defined easily in Haskell, which is another reason why Haskell is a good option for writing Plutus Core scripts. In practice, a smart contract developer will write validator scripts in Haskell, which will then be automatically [compiled into Plutus Core](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/02/plutus-tx-compiling-haskell-into-plutus-core/).\n\nAppropriate Haskell libraries simplify writing such validation logic by providing core data types for the inspection of transactions during validation, and by offering many helper functions and higher level abstractions, allowing contract authors to concentrate on the business logic and not have to worry about too many low-level details. \n\n## The Plutus Application Framework (PAF)\n\nThe on-chain state of validator scripts can only be modified by transactions that spend and produce script output. When writing a Plutus application, we need to consider not only the on-chain part of the application (the Plutus Core scripts) but also the off-chain part that builds and submits transactions.\n\nThe off-chain code is written in Haskell, just like the on-chain code. That way we only need to write the business logic once. Then we can use it in the validator script and in the code that builds the transactions that run the validator script. \n\nMany applications need to watch the UTXO set for changes to particular addresses, so if we write our contract as a state machine, we need to track the unspent output that represents the current state of the machine and update our local state when the on-chain state changes. Likewise, many apps need to communicate with the wallet backend to access the crypto currency that they are using for transactions.\n\nThe PAF provides easy access to services that are commonly used by Plutus applications. Applications deployed using the framework\u2019s libraries can be run on the Plutus application backend, which provides runtime support for access to the blockchain and other concerns such as persistence, logging, and monitoring. Applications written on top of the PAF automatically provide an HTTP and WebSocket interface that can be used to interact with the application from the web browser. \n\n## Native tokens\n\n*Native tokens* became available on Cardano with February\u2019s *Mary* hard fork. Any user can create their own tokens, and tokens can be sent and received freely, just like ada. Each native token comes with its own *[minting policy](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/native-tokens/learn-about-native-tokens.html#minting-policy)*, which determines the conditions under which tokens can be minted and burnt.\n\nAt the moment, these minting policies consist of combinations of simple rules specifying *signatures* and *timelocks*. For example, a policy can state that only transactions that are signed by two out of five possible signatures are allowed to mint or burn tokens. Another policy can allow minting only before or after a specific time slot.\n\nPowerful as these basic building blocks are, they do not cover every conceivable use. It is, for example, possible, but awkward, to model non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using such simple policies. This could be done using a timelock to mint an NFT, by limiting the minting operation to a specific time point. If only one token is minted before that time point is reached, the token is technically non-fungible (because there is only one). But to check this, it is not enough to simply check the minting policy. We\u2019d need to look at the minting history of the token to ensure it had, indeed, only been minted once.\n\nWith the deployment of Plutus, users will be able to write minting policies using Plutus core. During minting or burning, the Plutus Core policy script will be executed in the context of the minting or burning transaction, and the script will have to approve or forbid the action. This will further accelerate the growth of NFTs on Cardano by enabling the creation of much more complex minting policies, and allowing the creation of NFTs in a trustless manner.\n\nAlonzo is being gradually deployed to the mainnet via several testnets, so our partners and [Plutus pioneers](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-our-new-plutus-pioneer-program/) will be able to test Plutus Core by writing applications on Cardano throughout May and June prior to a code freeze. This will also be the period of quality assurance and user acceptance testing by exchanges to ensure that the platform is fully ready at the time of  the Alonzo mainnet upgrade.

With the introduction of [transaction metadata](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/10/29/bringing-new-value-and-utility-to-the-cardano-blockchain/), then [token-locking](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/02/goguen-brings-token-locking-to-cardano/) with Allegra in December, and [native token creation](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/18/building-native-tokens-on-cardano-for-pleasure-and-profit/), we are laying the foundation to establish Cardano as the leading smart contract platform. \n\nAlonzo, our next protocol upgrade, will build on these capabilities. Implemented using our hard fork combinator technology, Alonzo will add support for smart contracts \u2013 digital agreements \u2013 to Cardano about four months from now. It will open up opportunities for businesses and developers, by allowing the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) for decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWhen it came to naming these upgrades, we chose Allegra (Lord Byron's daughter) for token-locking, and Mary (the novelist and wife of Shelley) for multi-asset support. Alonzo comes from a more contemporary figure, Alonzo Church (1903-95). Church was a US mathematician and logician who worked on logic and the foundations of theoretical computer science. He is also known for inventing lambda calculus \u2012 a formal system used to prove the unsolvability of the *Entscheidungsproblem*. Later, while working with fellow mathematician Alan Turing, they discovered that the lambda calculus and the Turing machine were equal in capabilities, demonstrating various mechanical processes for computations. One of the reasons for naming our smart contract upgrade after Church is that Plutus Core (the Cardano smart contract language) is a variation of lambda calculus.\n\n## Why smart contracts?\n\nSmart contracts mark the next phase in Cardano's evolution as a worldwide distributed ledger. When supporting everyday business, a blockchain must guarantee that individuals can move their funds and pay for products in a secure way.\n\nSmart contracts can be used to settle complex deals, hold funds in escrow, and secure movement of funds under predefined conditions. Cardano will allow DApps to interact with the ledger to record their activities and execute smart contracts. These digital agreements express the story of a transaction, specify where funds should go, and under what conditions they will be sent, executing a deal only when all the conditions are met. Alonzo will lay the foundation for Cardano to support such applications. \n\n## Addressing business needs with Alonzo\n\nWhile multi-asset support allows users to create unique currencies that fuel business needs, Alonzo introduces a versatile platform for building smart contracts. It will be possible to work with collectibles, crowdfunding, or auctions, for example. \n\nAreas of exploration might include the deployment of escrow-based decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEX), or the creation of complex applications supporting centralized stablecoins (track-and-trace applications for product provenance within a supply chain, for example). With token-locking, users will be able to issue utility tokens with vesting periods, meaning that a number of tokens can be locked or frozen to be released after a specific time. \n\n## The scripting power of Plutus Core\n\nWith Alonzo, we are adding the necessary tools and the infrastructure to allow application development using the Plutus Platform. \n\nApplying a rigorous approach based on formal methods and verification, Alonzo extends the basic multi-signature scripting language (multisig) used in Cardano Shelley. Multisig will be upgraded to the Plutus Core language for more powerful and secure scripting options. The Alonzo ledger implements the [extended unspent transaction output (EUTXO)](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/12/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model-part-2/) accounting model, using Plutus Core to provide powerful scripting. \n\nA smart contract platform must be both secure and reliable. That\u2019s why we chose Haskell as the basis for writing Plutus Core smart contracts. Haskell is a high-level language that developers will use to write code and then [compile it to Plutus Core](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/02/plutus-tx-compiling-haskell-into-plutus-core/). \n\nHaskell has been around since 1987, standing out from other programming languages for its high level of trust.

With the introduction of [transaction metadata](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/10/29/bringing-new-value-and-utility-to-the-cardano-blockchain/), then [token-locking](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/02/goguen-brings-token-locking-to-cardano/) with Allegra in December, and [native token creation](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/18/building-native-tokens-on-cardano-for-pleasure-and-profit/), we are laying the foundation to establish Cardano as the leading smart contract platform. \n\nAlonzo, our next protocol upgrade, will build on these capabilities. Implemented using our hard fork combinator technology, Alonzo will add support for smart contracts \u2013 digital agreements \u2013 to Cardano about four months from now. It will open up opportunities for businesses and developers, by allowing the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) for decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWhen it came to naming these upgrades, we chose Allegra (Lord Byron's daughter) for token-locking, and Mary (the novelist and wife of Shelley) for multi-asset support. Alonzo comes from a more contemporary figure, Alonzo Church (1903-95). Church was a US mathematician and logician who worked on logic and the foundations of theoretical computer science. He is also known for inventing lambda calculus \u2012 a formal system used to prove the unsolvability of the *Entscheidungsproblem*. Later, while working with fellow mathematician Alan Turing, they discovered that the lambda calculus and the Turing machine were equal in capabilities, demonstrating various mechanical processes for computations. One of the reasons for naming our smart contract upgrade after Church is that Plutus Core (the Cardano smart contract language) is a variation of lambda calculus.\n\n## Why smart contracts?\n\nSmart contracts mark the next phase in Cardano's evolution as a worldwide distributed ledger. When supporting everyday business, a blockchain must guarantee that individuals can move their funds and pay for products in a secure way.\n\nSmart contracts can be used to settle complex deals, hold funds in escrow, and secure movement of funds under predefined conditions. Cardano will allow DApps to interact with the ledger to record their activities and execute smart contracts. These digital agreements express the story of a transaction, specify where funds should go, and under what conditions they will be sent, executing a deal only when all the conditions are met. Alonzo will lay the foundation for Cardano to support such applications. \n\n## Addressing business needs with Alonzo\n\nWhile multi-asset support allows users to create unique currencies that fuel business needs, Alonzo introduces a versatile platform for building smart contracts. It will be possible to work with collectibles, crowdfunding, or auctions, for example. \n\nAreas of exploration might include the deployment of escrow-based decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEX), or the creation of complex applications supporting centralized stablecoins (track-and-trace applications for product provenance within a supply chain, for example). With token-locking, users will be able to issue utility tokens with vesting periods, meaning that a number of tokens can be locked or frozen to be released after a specific time. \n\n## The scripting power of Plutus Core\n\nWith Alonzo, we are adding the necessary tools and the infrastructure to allow application development using the Plutus Platform. \n\nApplying a rigorous approach based on formal methods and verification, Alonzo extends the basic multi-signature scripting language (multisig) used in Cardano Shelley. Multisig will be upgraded to the Plutus Core language for more powerful and secure scripting options. The Alonzo ledger implements the [extended unspent transaction output (EUTXO)](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/12/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model-part-2/) accounting model, using Plutus Core to provide powerful scripting. \n\nA smart contract platform must be both secure and reliable. That\u2019s why we chose Haskell as the basis for writing Plutus Core smart contracts. Haskell is a high-level language that developers will use to write code and then [compile it to Plutus Core](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/02/plutus-tx-compiling-haskell-into-plutus-core/). \n\nHaskell has been around since 1987, standing out from other programming languages for its high level of trust. Writing in Haskell ensures that smart contracts are programmed to do exactly what they are expected to and can be tested for accuracy before implementation. This means that smart contracts built on Cardano will be straightforward and resistant to vulnerabilities, which is crucial for applications that handle automated trading or move large funds around. \n\n**Tools and APIs**\n\nDevelopers will have functional tools to experiment with and customize transaction validation on Cardano.

An essential element in this is reliable and effective connections between all the distributed nodes, and ensuring that the network is resilient to failure.\n\nWith the simpler Byron version of the blockchain, federated (OBFT) nodes controlled by the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOHK were wholly responsible for managing block production and network connections. This maintained the network, while building up a system of thousands of distributed nodes, operated by stake pools. To achieve decentralization, Cardano has now ended the prevalence of the federated nodes that have supported the system since its creation in 2017. \n\nOn December 6, 2020, we set the [*k* parameter to 500](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11/05/parameters-and-decentralization-the-way-ahead/) to expand the number of \u2018viable\u2019 pools and further promote decentralization. We have also [gradually reduced *d*](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/04/not-long-till-d-0-day/) to put the power of block production entirely into the hands of the community. 100% of blocks are now being produced by the stake pool operator (SPO) community, which means that block production in Cardano is completely decentralized. These parameter changes support long-term chain sustainability and encourage the spreading of stake and potential rewards more evenly among stake pools.\n\nIn just over six months, we have evolved from a system reliant upon a handful of federated nodes, into a proof-of-stake system run by the community, with thousands of blocks produced every epoch by over 2,000 stake pools.  \n\n## The network\n\nCardano\u2019s networking layer is a physical infrastructure that combines nodes and their interaction into a unified system. The network distributes information about transactions and block creation among all active nodes. In this way, the system validates and adds blocks to the chain and verifies transactions. Thus, a distributed network of nodes must keep communication delays to a minimum, and be resilient enough to cope with failures, capacity constraints, or hackers.\n\nUnder the old federated system, nodes were connected by a static configuration defined in a topology file. Since the introduction of Shelley, the system has been functioning in a hybrid mode, where nodes connect to federated relays and to other SPO\u2019s relays. This connectivity is partially manually constructed, however, SPOs can exchange block and transaction information without relying on federated nodes. \n\nIn his article '[Cardano\u2019s path to decentralization](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/07/09/cardanos-path-to-decentralization-by-marcin-szamotulski/)', Marcin Szamotulski discussed the network\u2019s design and explained Cardano\u2019s approach to network decentralization with the advent of Shelley. Now that we have reached full decentralization in terms of block production, it is also essential that the network connectivity is decentralized too. Cardano will achieve this through a shift to peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity. \n\n## P2P networking\n\nAt this point, we should talk about the network \u2018stack\u2019, a set of software tools recently enhanced by our engineering team to cope with a larger, more dynamic, and complex network.\n\nP2P communication will enhance the flow of information between nodes, thus reducing (and ultimately removing) the network\u2019s reliance on the federated nodes, and enabling the decentralization of Cardano. To achieve the desired resilience, IOHK\u2019s networking team has been busy improving the network stack with advanced P2P capabilities. These improvements do not require a protocol change, but rather enable automated peer selection and communication. \n\nThe P2P networking is enabled due to the use of the following components:\n\n![network P2P architecture](https://ucarecdn.com/ae952f4d-fe2e-4b59-b563-9a7a18377123/ \"network P2P architecture\")\n\nFigure 1. P2P architecture\n\nLet's take a closer look at the process of how node connections are established and see how the latest developments streamline data exchange between nodes.  \n\n**Mini protocols**\n\nA set of mini protocols enables communication between nodes. Each protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks, or processing transactions. *Chain-sync*, *block-fetch*, and *tx-submission* protocols have been used to distribute chains of blocks and transactions for node-to-node communication in the network:\n\n* *block-fetch* draws information from the chain database.\n* *chain-sync* synchronizes fetched data across the network.\n* *tx-submission2* consumes transactions from peer mempools and adds them to the local mempool, which enables peers to submit their transactions to the node. This is a modification of the current *tx-submission* protocol. \n\nThese mini protocols support the Ouroboros consensus protocol. To ensure optimal networking service, the team has implemented additional protocols:\n\n* *keep-alive*: this ensures continuous connection between nodes and minimizes performance faults. \n* *tip-sample*: this provides information about which peers offer better connectivity in terms of performance.  \n\nYou can find out more about the network architecture and mini protocol examples on the [Cardano documentation website](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/cardano-network.html).\n\n**Connection management**\n\nThe networking service supports Linux, Windows, and macOS, but the number of connections supported by each operating system varies.\n\nTo avoid system overloading, a [multiplexer](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/cardano-architecture-overview/connection-management.html#multiplexing) combines several channels into a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection channel. This offers two advantages: One, bidirectional communication between peers (so any peer can initiate communication with no restrictions as both parties have read and write permissions within the same channel), and enhanced node-to-node communication without affecting performance.\n\nThe networking team has implemented a bidirectional-aware \u2018connection manager\u2019 that integrates with the P2P governor, which is currently undergoing final testing before deployment. Additionally, the multiplexer\u2019s API has been upgraded to monitor new connections and protocols. This enhancement introduces more efficient connection management and improved issue tracking. \n\n**P2P governor functionality**\n\nThe Cardano network involves multiple peer nodes. Some are more active than others, some have established connections, and some should be promoted to ensure the best system performance. As discussed in '[Cardano\u2019s path to decentralization](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/07/09/cardanos-path-to-decentralization-by-marcin-szamotulski/)', peers are mapped into three categories:\n\n* cold peers\n* warm peers\n* hot peers\n\nTo establish bidirectional connections between them, it is crucial that we know which connections are active. \n\n![cardano peer discovery](https://ucarecdn.com/174748e1-4b15-4735-be59-5bee57ecb48d/ \"Peer discovery on Cardano\")\n\nFigure 2. Peer discovery on Cardano\n\nThe [P2P governor](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/ouroboros-network/Ouroboros-Network-PeerSelection-Governor.html) manages connections and provides information on which peers are active and performing well. This feature promotes peer connections for enhanced system performance and also provides excellent visibility by building and maintaining a connectivity map of the entire network. The governor will simplify the process of connection definitions by handling these automatically so a few central stake pools no longer have to configure them manually. The governor promotes or demotes peers between cold, warm, and hot states, and also interacts with the connection manager to open new connections or reuse existing ones.\n\n## P2P deployment roadmap\n\nThe IOHK networking team is in the final stages of quality testing the P2P governor integration with the node. After this, the team will extend the network stack with more protocols \u2013 *gossip*, in particular, which will provide seamless data exchange between peers and help construct a decentralized communication map. \n\nThese technical upgrades allow us to simplify Cardano node interfaces and improve the system\u2019s configuration. When testing is finalized, all SPOs will be able to update and simplify their configuration preferences for enhanced connectivity. \n\nThis involves the following stages before full P2P deployment:\n\n![Cardano P2P roadmap](https://ucarecdn.com/239cc27f-ea38-4e84-8136-3c164f95b6c6/ \"P2P deployment roadmap\")\n\nFigure 3.

These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2.

Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment.

We will also be holding regular Q&A sessions and you will have access to a dedicated community channel on Discord, created especially to help you to connect with other course participants as you learn. \r\n\r\nOutside the exercises and videos, students will be encouraged to learn at a pace that is right for them and to collaborate with fellow students. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week. These moderators are all graduates of the [Mongolia class of 2020](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/21/online-learning-with-haskell-the-mongolia-class-of-2020/) that completed the Haskell MOOC and are well placed to assist with questions and challenges. At the close of each week, Lars will engage directly with the group to resolve more complex technical questions and provide feedback on the subject matter covered that week. \r\n\r\n## Prior experience ##\r\nAs Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language), will be very helpful. At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts. We are also developing education programs for both [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/marlowe/marlowe-explainer.html) and [Glow](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), so don't feel like you have missed out if this Plutus course is not for you. We\u2019re still keen to have you onboard, so do watch this space for details of these other courses!\r\n\r\n## Certification ##\r\nWe will reward participants for their efforts in participating in this course and certify those pioneers that complete the entire program and are successful. These Plutus pioneer certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their knowledge and qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.\r\n \r\n## Ready to start ##\r\nWe are excited to have so many developers from our ecosystem on board and ready to get started and learn Plutus. You\u2019ll not only be learning yourselves, but acting as a pioneer to help us determine the best way to teach and deliver this course \u2013 truly helping pave the way for future cohorts who enroll!

Serving as the next-generation digital currency platform, ETC is built as an intuitive programming platform, which allows developers of all skill sets to build the next wave of market disrupting decentralized applications (DApps). \n\nThe goal of ETC is to securely and methodically establish a strong ecosystem underpinned by solid foundation and core immutability. However, recent 51% attacks have put the ETC ecosystem into a precarious position, denting its confidence and challenging the community\u2019s ability to address this issue, while representing an existential threat to its future viability. \n\n## Driving\u00a0innovation\u00a0&\u00a0future\u00a0growth\u00a0for\u00a0ETC\n\nNew Mantis is the only client that is written natively for Ethereum Classic and it offers unrivalled levels of assurance, security, and usability. IOHK has relaunched the Mantis project to mitigate against the recent attacks, provide enhanced security, and establish a robust means of interacting with the ETC chain. A commitment to fostering innovation and sustainability lies at the heart of the project. We are aiming to provide a steady funding income with the establishment of a proto-treasury to nurture future development and growth. This Mantis re-launch represents the culmination of a project that we've been working on for some time. Over the past few months, we have resurrected our code base, and gathered a dedicated Mantis team together who have worked hard to refine and improve the code and deliver important new features.\n\n## What\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Mantis\u00a0project?\n\nMantis is a project that is built for the community, specifically designed for the developers, wallet users, and infrastructure providers to enable direct interaction with the ETC blockchain. Essentially, it is a place where future development can evolve and be tested by the community. The Mantis release includes the following components:\n- Mantis client - a CLI tool that connects to other clients in a peer-to-peer manner to allow users to communicate with the ETC chain, send and receive transactions, sync the blockchain data, execute and validate smart contracts, and deploy new smart contracts on-chain.\r\n- Mantis wallet - a node wallet with incorporated graphical user interface (GUI), which connects to both mainnet and the Sagano and Mordor testnets. \r\n- Mantis faucet - enables developers to receive testnet funds for use on the Sagano and Mordor testnets.\r\n- Mantis explorer - allows tracking recent activities and transactions in regards to the ETC chain, covering the ETC mainnet, and Sagano and Mordor testnets. \n\nPlease visit the [Mantis website](https://mantisclient.io/) where you can download the latest version of both the Mantis client and wallet.\r\n\r\nMantis software implements the official Ethereum Classic specification and Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals [(ECIPs)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) introduced by ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem. The project has undergone a number of enhancements in terms of adding robustness and variety to the client offering, including optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term. It has been developed from the ground up and built in 100% Scala code, a functional programming language that offers security guarantees that other languages do not. Mantis features include stable peer discovery, pruning, fast synchronization, and newly implemented checkpointing (for 51% attack resistance) and proto-treasury (for long-term sustainability). Let\u2019s take a closer look at these features.\n\n## Checkpointing \r\n*Persistence* and *liveness* are two crucial properties that a transaction ledger should possess. It is a proven fact that both persistence and liveness suffer when the adversarial mining power in the proof of work surpasses 50%, and in the recent year, ETC has undergone several double-spending attacks prompted by the creation of large chain reorganizations. Considering that persistence and liveness were not guaranteed within the ETC network, we sought to implement protocol changes that will re-establish persistence and liveness under current network conditions, and *checkpointing* is one of the proposed solutions. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered, by using the *k* parameter, or depth parameter, where every *k* block gets irreversibly \"checkpointed\", meaning that no one can ever drop or revert it. A trusted authority can choose the block on which to issue a checkpoint, which means that they can decide which block becomes the canonical chain that all parties should follow. This trusted authority must run continuously and is responsible for publishing the checkpoint to the network. Checkpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered with regards to mining. The mining rewards are not affected and the checkpointing federation can only issue checkpoints on blocks that have valid proof of work and cannot mint blocks on its own. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing is now implemented within the Mantis project, and according to our recent [ECIP comparison for 51% attack resistance](https://static.iohk.io/docs/etc/ecip-comparison-for-51-attack-resistance.pdf), it provides far greater, and importantly formally proven, security against these types of attacks. It is important that any 51% attack mitigation is truly robust enough to give absolute certainty to ETC holders, users, and service providers that their transactions will be secure.\r\n\n## Proto-Treasury\r\nFor the longer-term health and success of the ETC ecosystem, we position network growth, sustainability, and innovation as key elements to ensure network security. With that in mind, we are implementing a proto-treasury system within the Mantis project to establish a steady funding income.  A well-developed governance strategy will enable effective, distributed funding for the long-term development of Mantis, whereas a decentralized treasury would ensure two important things for the future of the ecosystem:\r\n- Firstly, it would provide a permanent ongoing source of funding for the ETC network. while increasing the value of the ecosystem and promoting greater developer engagement. \r\n\r\n- Secondly, it would provide a distributed and transparent funding mechanism, which lets the ETC community determine its future growth and enable the sustainability required for innovation and growth.\r\n\r\nEstablishing the treasury for funding purposes ensures a clear vision of the substantial system maintenance focused to obtain innovation and diversity from other projects, including proof of stake (PoS) and newer blockchains. This solution is straightforward in its optimization for speed and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal foresees to distribute 80% of existing mining rewards to miners and 20% to the proto-treasury smart contract. The treasury will be controlled by the community and will enable a decentralized, collaborative decision-making process, offering an opt-in type collaboration for those who are interested.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\r\nAs much as we\u2019re excited about the Mantis relaunch, it should be stressed that its capability won\u2019t be limited to just the features outlined here. Mantis is an evolving project and right now we are establishing its foundational building blocks and running rigorous security audits.

Serving as the next-generation digital currency platform, ETC is built as an intuitive programming platform, which allows developers of all skill sets to build the next wave of market disrupting decentralized applications (DApps). \n\nThe goal of ETC is to securely and methodically establish a strong ecosystem underpinned by solid foundation and core immutability. However, recent 51% attacks have put the ETC ecosystem into a precarious position, denting its confidence and challenging the community\u2019s ability to address this issue, while representing an existential threat to its future viability. \n\n## Driving\u00a0innovation\u00a0&\u00a0future\u00a0growth\u00a0for\u00a0ETC\n\nNew Mantis is the only client that is written natively for Ethereum Classic and it offers unrivalled levels of assurance, security, and usability. IOHK has relaunched the Mantis project to mitigate against the recent attacks, provide enhanced security, and establish a robust means of interacting with the ETC chain. A commitment to fostering innovation and sustainability lies at the heart of the project. We are aiming to provide a steady funding income with the establishment of a proto-treasury to nurture future development and growth. This Mantis re-launch represents the culmination of a project that we've been working on for some time. Over the past few months, we have resurrected our code base, and gathered a dedicated Mantis team together who have worked hard to refine and improve the code and deliver important new features.\n\n## What\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Mantis\u00a0project?\n\nMantis is a project that is built for the community, specifically designed for the developers, wallet users, and infrastructure providers to enable direct interaction with the ETC blockchain. Essentially, it is a place where future development can evolve and be tested by the community. The Mantis release includes the following components:\n- Mantis client - a CLI tool that connects to other clients in a peer-to-peer manner to allow users to communicate with the ETC chain, send and receive transactions, sync the blockchain data, execute and validate smart contracts, and deploy new smart contracts on-chain.\r\n- Mantis wallet - a node wallet with incorporated graphical user interface (GUI), which connects to both mainnet and the Sagano and Mordor testnets. \r\n- Mantis faucet - enables developers to receive testnet funds for use on the Sagano and Mordor testnets.\r\n- Mantis explorer - allows tracking recent activities and transactions in regards to the ETC chain, covering the ETC mainnet, and Sagano and Mordor testnets. \n\nPlease visit the [Mantis website](https://mantisclient.io/) where you can download the latest version of both the Mantis client and wallet.\r\n\r\nMantis software implements the official Ethereum Classic specification and Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals [(ECIPs)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) introduced by ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem. The project has undergone a number of enhancements in terms of adding robustness and variety to the client offering, including optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term. It has been developed from the ground up and built in 100% Scala code, a functional programming language that offers security guarantees that other languages do not. Mantis features include stable peer discovery, pruning, fast synchronization, and newly implemented checkpointing (for 51% attack resistance) and proto-treasury (for long-term sustainability). Let\u2019s take a closer look at these features.\n\n## Checkpointing \r\n*Persistence* and *liveness* are two crucial properties that a transaction ledger should possess. It is a proven fact that both persistence and liveness suffer when the adversarial mining power in the proof of work surpasses 50%, and in the recent year, ETC has undergone several double-spending attacks prompted by the creation of large chain reorganizations. Considering that persistence and liveness were not guaranteed within the ETC network, we sought to implement protocol changes that will re-establish persistence and liveness under current network conditions, and *checkpointing* is one of the proposed solutions. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered, by using the *k* parameter, or depth parameter, where every *k* block gets irreversibly \"checkpointed\", meaning that no one can ever drop or revert it. A trusted authority can choose the block on which to issue a checkpoint, which means that they can decide which block becomes the canonical chain that all parties should follow. This trusted authority must run continuously and is responsible for publishing the checkpoint to the network. Checkpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered with regards to mining. The mining rewards are not affected and the checkpointing federation can only issue checkpoints on blocks that have valid proof of work and cannot mint blocks on its own. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing is now implemented within the Mantis project, and according to our recent [ECIP comparison for 51% attack resistance](https://static.iohk.io/docs/etc/ecip-comparison-for-51-attack-resistance.pdf), it provides far greater, and importantly formally proven, security against these types of attacks. It is important that any 51% attack mitigation is truly robust enough to give absolute certainty to ETC holders, users, and service providers that their transactions will be secure.\r\n\n## Proto-Treasury\r\nFor the longer-term health and success of the ETC ecosystem, we position network growth, sustainability, and innovation as key elements to ensure network security. With that in mind, we are implementing a proto-treasury system within the Mantis project to establish a steady funding income.  A well-developed governance strategy will enable effective, distributed funding for the long-term development of Mantis, whereas a decentralized treasury would ensure two important things for the future of the ecosystem:\r\n- Firstly, it would provide a permanent ongoing source of funding for the ETC network. while increasing the value of the ecosystem and promoting greater developer engagement. \r\n\r\n- Secondly, it would provide a distributed and transparent funding mechanism, which lets the ETC community determine its future growth and enable the sustainability required for innovation and growth.\r\n\r\nEstablishing the treasury for funding purposes ensures a clear vision of the substantial system maintenance focused to obtain innovation and diversity from other projects, including proof of stake (PoS) and newer blockchains. This solution is straightforward in its optimization for speed and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal foresees to distribute 80% of existing mining rewards to miners and 20% to the proto-treasury smart contract. The treasury will be controlled by the community and will enable a decentralized, collaborative decision-making process, offering an opt-in type collaboration for those who are interested.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\r\nAs much as we\u2019re excited about the Mantis relaunch, it should be stressed that its capability won\u2019t be limited to just the features outlined here. Mantis is an evolving project and right now we are establishing its foundational building blocks and running rigorous security audits. Further down the road, it will see more performance improvements in terms of CPU, GPU and ASICs compatibility, a new proof-of-work consensus protocol and algorithm introduction (PRISM consensus, Keccak256 algorithm) and, of course, additional enhancements for better interoperability and speed of transaction processing.

A key focus in IOHK for 2020 is to develop and expand our education materials as we transition fully into the Shelley era and then to the Goguen era of Cardano.\n\nThe IOHK education team will be investing significant time and effort this year in broadening our range of materials. We aim to enhance understanding of our technologies using a variety of learning and training assets targeted at a wide range of stakeholder audiences, both internal and external. This will be vital as the use of IOHK technology moves into the mainstream. We also aim to provide knowledge and information to enterprise decision-makers so they know what business problems our technologies can solve. We have lots planned and many projects are underway as we grow Cardano into a global social and financial operating system.\n\n## What can you expect?\n\nWe started 2020 with lectures, by Dr Lars Br\u00fcnjes, our director of education, at the University of Malta. The focus of these lectures was on Plutus and Marlowe, our programming languages for smart contracts. The fruits of these sessions will, in turn, form the foundation of some modular training materials that we plan to formalize and develop over the coming months.\n\nOur free Udemy courses on [Plutus](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/) and [Marlowe](https://www.udemy.com/course/marlowe-programming-language/) by Alejandro Garcia have proven very popular, with over 5,000 students signed up. Feedback has been positive and, as a result of what we learned from our students, we\u2019ve been making incremental improvements over the last year. We now want to take this to the next level and are planning to fully update both courses soon to bring them up to speed with the latest development changes and new features. We are also in the initial planning stages for a second edition of the ebook, [Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts](https://leanpub.com/plutus-smart-contracts) by Lars Br\u00fcnjes and Polina Vinogradova, which we will be publishing later this year. The writing team has started to identify improvements and we are also gathering feedback directly from readers. If you have suggestions, please raise a pull request in our [Plutus ebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-book) with your ideas.\n\nAn important step in bridging the gap between our academic papers and mainstream understanding of these concepts is to teach people about Ouroboros, the proof-of-stake protocol that powers Cardano and ada. In response to the valuable feedback we have received from running the Incentivized Testnet, we are planning to create varied educational content to help stake pool operators understand Ouroboros and how the protocol works on a practical level.\n\n## Broadening our reach\n\nTo broaden the reach of our training courses and content, we are also investigating a way to migrate our popular Haskell training course into a massive online course, or MOOC, while also making it more comprehensive with the inclusion of Plutus and Marlowe material. In this way, we hope our MOOC will make the course even more valuable, and provide access to the widest possible global community. In addition, we are planning a comprehensive classroom-based Haskell and Plutus course in Mongolia, details of which will be finalized soon. We plan to use the introductory part of the online Haskell course as a primer for this face-to-face training. This is an example of a core efficiency that we are embracing where we aim to reuse content on Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe across a variety of stand-alone modular materials that we can use externally and within the company for developing our staff.\n\nWe appreciate the value of interactive and meaningful training workshops, so we intend to host many more this year in several locations around the world. These events are in the initial planning stages and the first in the series will take place in Quebec in the spring. We\u2019ll announce more details through our official channels \u2013 Twitter, email, here \u2013 nearer the time. The IOHK education team are on hand to support and prepare the necessary learning tools for participants to use at these events.\n\nAlongside these materials and courses, we are mentoring an undergraduate student at the International University of Management (ISM), with her thesis on the topic of the power of blockchain in emerging markets. Additionally, Dr Jamie Gabbay has been invited to contribute to the book '*Applications of new generation technology to cryptocurrencies, banking, and finance*\u2019 by Devraj Basu.\n\n## Internal initiatives\n\nWe are also working with our human resources team to build the IOHK Training Academy: a new learning portal for our internal teams to upskill and develop professionally. This new resource is part of our learning and development strategy that aims to improve employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We want to provide access to a library of assets so our staff can easily find exactly what they need. We will be developing tailored \u2018learning journeys\u2019 by function, ready-made content that will help people develop skills in new areas, as well as creating specific onboarding journeys for new starters. This is a vital resource for a fast-growing company with staff and contractors spread across 43 countries and will prove to be an important asset for all our people.\n\n2020 is going to be a pivotal year for Cardano and we are looking forward to playing our part. It is our aim to teach both individuals and organizations how to use the protocol, and how it can help with their everyday lives.

These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways.

For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "a-close-look-at-the-software-running-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/06/08/a-close-look-at-the-software-running-cardano/", "read_time": 5}, {"publish_date": "2021-04-30T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/65cf3157-04f6-4e3c-9c8e-4ef6f51dc047/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "The essential Cardano list - a new resource for the community", "subtitle": "Introducing a new central source for all things Cardano-related", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Today sees the publication of [the Essential Cardano list](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano) \u2013 a new GitHub repository which will help you to find out everything you need to know about Cardano.

This week we have contacted everyone interested (over 2,000) to get a better idea of their experience and expertise. Those of you who have been selected for the first round of this program will hear from us very soon.

The cohort joining this program will be true pioneers. As well as being part of a group that will have *early access* to a set of learning modules, your feedback will help us develop and iterate the overall learning experience.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe course will teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus.

We will also be holding regular Q&A sessions and you will have access to a dedicated community channel on Discord, created especially to help you to connect with other course participants as you learn. \r\n\r\nOutside the exercises and videos, students will be encouraged to learn at a pace that is right for them and to collaborate with fellow students. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week. These moderators are all graduates of the [Mongolia class of 2020](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/21/online-learning-with-haskell-the-mongolia-class-of-2020/) that completed the Haskell MOOC and are well placed to assist with questions and challenges. At the close of each week, Lars will engage directly with the group to resolve more complex technical questions and provide feedback on the subject matter covered that week. \r\n\r\n## Prior experience ##\r\nAs Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language), will be very helpful. At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts. We are also developing education programs for both [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/marlowe/marlowe-explainer.html) and [Glow](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), so don't feel like you have missed out if this Plutus course is not for you. We\u2019re still keen to have you onboard, so do watch this space for details of these other courses!\r\n\r\n## Certification ##\r\nWe will reward participants for their efforts in participating in this course and certify those pioneers that complete the entire program and are successful. These Plutus pioneer certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their knowledge and qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.\r\n \r\n## Ready to start ##\r\nWe are excited to have so many developers from our ecosystem on board and ready to get started and learn Plutus. You\u2019ll not only be learning yourselves, but acting as a pioneer to help us determine the best way to teach and deliver this course \u2013 truly helping pave the way for future cohorts who enroll!

Serving as the next-generation digital currency platform, ETC is built as an intuitive programming platform, which allows developers of all skill sets to build the next wave of market disrupting decentralized applications (DApps). \n\nThe goal of ETC is to securely and methodically establish a strong ecosystem underpinned by solid foundation and core immutability. However, recent 51% attacks have put the ETC ecosystem into a precarious position, denting its confidence and challenging the community\u2019s ability to address this issue, while representing an existential threat to its future viability. \n\n## Driving\u00a0innovation\u00a0&\u00a0future\u00a0growth\u00a0for\u00a0ETC\n\nNew Mantis is the only client that is written natively for Ethereum Classic and it offers unrivalled levels of assurance, security, and usability. IOHK has relaunched the Mantis project to mitigate against the recent attacks, provide enhanced security, and establish a robust means of interacting with the ETC chain. A commitment to fostering innovation and sustainability lies at the heart of the project. We are aiming to provide a steady funding income with the establishment of a proto-treasury to nurture future development and growth. This Mantis re-launch represents the culmination of a project that we've been working on for some time. Over the past few months, we have resurrected our code base, and gathered a dedicated Mantis team together who have worked hard to refine and improve the code and deliver important new features.\n\n## What\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Mantis\u00a0project?\n\nMantis is a project that is built for the community, specifically designed for the developers, wallet users, and infrastructure providers to enable direct interaction with the ETC blockchain. Essentially, it is a place where future development can evolve and be tested by the community. The Mantis release includes the following components:\n- Mantis client - a CLI tool that connects to other clients in a peer-to-peer manner to allow users to communicate with the ETC chain, send and receive transactions, sync the blockchain data, execute and validate smart contracts, and deploy new smart contracts on-chain.\r\n- Mantis wallet - a node wallet with incorporated graphical user interface (GUI), which connects to both mainnet and the Sagano and Mordor testnets. \r\n- Mantis faucet - enables developers to receive testnet funds for use on the Sagano and Mordor testnets.\r\n- Mantis explorer - allows tracking recent activities and transactions in regards to the ETC chain, covering the ETC mainnet, and Sagano and Mordor testnets. \n\nPlease visit the [Mantis website](https://mantisclient.io/) where you can download the latest version of both the Mantis client and wallet.\r\n\r\nMantis software implements the official Ethereum Classic specification and Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals [(ECIPs)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) introduced by ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem. The project has undergone a number of enhancements in terms of adding robustness and variety to the client offering, including optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term. It has been developed from the ground up and built in 100% Scala code, a functional programming language that offers security guarantees that other languages do not. Mantis features include stable peer discovery, pruning, fast synchronization, and newly implemented checkpointing (for 51% attack resistance) and proto-treasury (for long-term sustainability). Let\u2019s take a closer look at these features.\n\n## Checkpointing \r\n*Persistence* and *liveness* are two crucial properties that a transaction ledger should possess. It is a proven fact that both persistence and liveness suffer when the adversarial mining power in the proof of work surpasses 50%, and in the recent year, ETC has undergone several double-spending attacks prompted by the creation of large chain reorganizations. Considering that persistence and liveness were not guaranteed within the ETC network, we sought to implement protocol changes that will re-establish persistence and liveness under current network conditions, and *checkpointing* is one of the proposed solutions. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered, by using the *k* parameter, or depth parameter, where every *k* block gets irreversibly \"checkpointed\", meaning that no one can ever drop or revert it. A trusted authority can choose the block on which to issue a checkpoint, which means that they can decide which block becomes the canonical chain that all parties should follow. This trusted authority must run continuously and is responsible for publishing the checkpoint to the network. Checkpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered with regards to mining. The mining rewards are not affected and the checkpointing federation can only issue checkpoints on blocks that have valid proof of work and cannot mint blocks on its own. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing is now implemented within the Mantis project, and according to our recent [ECIP comparison for 51% attack resistance](https://static.iohk.io/docs/etc/ecip-comparison-for-51-attack-resistance.pdf), it provides far greater, and importantly formally proven, security against these types of attacks. It is important that any 51% attack mitigation is truly robust enough to give absolute certainty to ETC holders, users, and service providers that their transactions will be secure.\r\n\n## Proto-Treasury\r\nFor the longer-term health and success of the ETC ecosystem, we position network growth, sustainability, and innovation as key elements to ensure network security. With that in mind, we are implementing a proto-treasury system within the Mantis project to establish a steady funding income.  A well-developed governance strategy will enable effective, distributed funding for the long-term development of Mantis, whereas a decentralized treasury would ensure two important things for the future of the ecosystem:\r\n- Firstly, it would provide a permanent ongoing source of funding for the ETC network. while increasing the value of the ecosystem and promoting greater developer engagement. \r\n\r\n- Secondly, it would provide a distributed and transparent funding mechanism, which lets the ETC community determine its future growth and enable the sustainability required for innovation and growth.\r\n\r\nEstablishing the treasury for funding purposes ensures a clear vision of the substantial system maintenance focused to obtain innovation and diversity from other projects, including proof of stake (PoS) and newer blockchains. This solution is straightforward in its optimization for speed and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal foresees to distribute 80% of existing mining rewards to miners and 20% to the proto-treasury smart contract. The treasury will be controlled by the community and will enable a decentralized, collaborative decision-making process, offering an opt-in type collaboration for those who are interested.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\r\nAs much as we\u2019re excited about the Mantis relaunch, it should be stressed that its capability won\u2019t be limited to just the features outlined here. Mantis is an evolving project and right now we are establishing its foundational building blocks and running rigorous security audits. Further down the road, it will see more performance improvements in terms of CPU, GPU and ASICs compatibility, a new proof-of-work consensus protocol and algorithm introduction (PRISM consensus, Keccak256 algorithm) and, of course, additional enhancements for better interoperability and speed of transaction processing.

Serving as the next-generation digital currency platform, ETC is built as an intuitive programming platform, which allows developers of all skill sets to build the next wave of market disrupting decentralized applications (DApps). \n\nThe goal of ETC is to securely and methodically establish a strong ecosystem underpinned by solid foundation and core immutability. However, recent 51% attacks have put the ETC ecosystem into a precarious position, denting its confidence and challenging the community\u2019s ability to address this issue, while representing an existential threat to its future viability. \n\n## Driving\u00a0innovation\u00a0&\u00a0future\u00a0growth\u00a0for\u00a0ETC\n\nNew Mantis is the only client that is written natively for Ethereum Classic and it offers unrivalled levels of assurance, security, and usability. IOHK has relaunched the Mantis project to mitigate against the recent attacks, provide enhanced security, and establish a robust means of interacting with the ETC chain. A commitment to fostering innovation and sustainability lies at the heart of the project. We are aiming to provide a steady funding income with the establishment of a proto-treasury to nurture future development and growth. This Mantis re-launch represents the culmination of a project that we've been working on for some time. Over the past few months, we have resurrected our code base, and gathered a dedicated Mantis team together who have worked hard to refine and improve the code and deliver important new features.\n\n## What\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Mantis\u00a0project?\n\nMantis is a project that is built for the community, specifically designed for the developers, wallet users, and infrastructure providers to enable direct interaction with the ETC blockchain.

Our mission is to grow our global community and business through the medium of education, and to share what we have learned. By claiming leadership in worldwide education on blockchain technology, we have the chance to shape the field for generations and to leave a lasting legacy.\n\nA consistent theme from 2019 has been the demand for a broad range of educational content, as demonstrated by the feedback received about the Incentivized Testnet, as well as the steady flow of support requests to our helpdesk. A key focus in IOHK for 2020 is to develop and expand our education materials as we transition fully into the Shelley era and then to the Goguen era of Cardano.\n\nThe IOHK education team will be investing significant time and effort this year in broadening our range of materials. We aim to enhance understanding of our technologies using a variety of learning and training assets targeted at a wide range of stakeholder audiences, both internal and external. This will be vital as the use of IOHK technology moves into the mainstream. We also aim to provide knowledge and information to enterprise decision-makers so they know what business problems our technologies can solve. We have lots planned and many projects are underway as we grow Cardano into a global social and financial operating system.\n\n## What can you expect?\n\nWe started 2020 with lectures, by Dr Lars Br\u00fcnjes, our director of education, at the University of Malta. The focus of these lectures was on Plutus and Marlowe, our programming languages for smart contracts. The fruits of these sessions will, in turn, form the foundation of some modular training materials that we plan to formalize and develop over the coming months.\n\nOur free Udemy courses on [Plutus](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/) and [Marlowe](https://www.udemy.com/course/marlowe-programming-language/) by Alejandro Garcia have proven very popular, with over 5,000 students signed up. Feedback has been positive and, as a result of what we learned from our students, we\u2019ve been making incremental improvements over the last year. We now want to take this to the next level and are planning to fully update both courses soon to bring them up to speed with the latest development changes and new features. We are also in the initial planning stages for a second edition of the ebook, [Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts](https://leanpub.com/plutus-smart-contracts) by Lars Br\u00fcnjes and Polina Vinogradova, which we will be publishing later this year. The writing team has started to identify improvements and we are also gathering feedback directly from readers. If you have suggestions, please raise a pull request in our [Plutus ebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-book) with your ideas.\n\nAn important step in bridging the gap between our academic papers and mainstream understanding of these concepts is to teach people about Ouroboros, the proof-of-stake protocol that powers Cardano and ada. In response to the valuable feedback we have received from running the Incentivized Testnet, we are planning to create varied educational content to help stake pool operators understand Ouroboros and how the protocol works on a practical level.\n\n## Broadening our reach\n\nTo broaden the reach of our training courses and content, we are also investigating a way to migrate our popular Haskell training course into a massive online course, or MOOC, while also making it more comprehensive with the inclusion of Plutus and Marlowe material. In this way, we hope our MOOC will make the course even more valuable, and provide access to the widest possible global community. In addition, we are planning a comprehensive classroom-based Haskell and Plutus course in Mongolia, details of which will be finalized soon. We plan to use the introductory part of the online Haskell course as a primer for this face-to-face training. This is an example of a core efficiency that we are embracing where we aim to reuse content on Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe across a variety of stand-alone modular materials that we can use externally and within the company for developing our staff.\n\nWe appreciate the value of interactive and meaningful training workshops, so we intend to host many more this year in several locations around the world. These events are in the initial planning stages and the first in the series will take place in Quebec in the spring. We\u2019ll announce more details through our official channels \u2013 Twitter, email, here \u2013 nearer the time. The IOHK education team are on hand to support and prepare the necessary learning tools for participants to use at these events.\n\nAlongside these materials and courses, we are mentoring an undergraduate student at the International University of Management (ISM), with her thesis on the topic of the power of blockchain in emerging markets. Additionally, Dr Jamie Gabbay has been invited to contribute to the book '*Applications of new generation technology to cryptocurrencies, banking, and finance*\u2019 by Devraj Basu.\n\n## Internal initiatives\n\nWe are also working with our human resources team to build the IOHK Training Academy: a new learning portal for our internal teams to upskill and develop professionally. This new resource is part of our learning and development strategy that aims to improve employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We want to provide access to a library of assets so our staff can easily find exactly what they need. We will be developing tailored \u2018learning journeys\u2019 by function, ready-made content that will help people develop skills in new areas, as well as creating specific onboarding journeys for new starters. This is a vital resource for a fast-growing company with staff and contractors spread across 43 countries and will prove to be an important asset for all our people.\n\n2020 is going to be a pivotal year for Cardano and we are looking forward to playing our part. It is our aim to teach both individuals and organizations how to use the protocol, and how it can help with their everyday lives.

These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano.

These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack.

Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

Cardano and the Nervos Network. Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using.

This week, building on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://developers.cardano.org/en/virtual-machines/welcome/), we\u2019re rolling out a new [development environment](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/) to support the Glow language.*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau of Mutual Knowledge Systems is the creator of Glow, a DSL that will allow anyone to write verifiable DApps from a single spec and deploy it on our EVM network. We caught up with Rideau (also known as Fare) to hear more about his vision for Glow and the Cardano journey so far. The following is a distillation of his thoughts from our previous interviews.*\n\n\n\n**We first introduced the community to GLOW and MuKn at the end of [last year](https://youtu.be/lj9SlvOIBgU?t=2902) when we announced our devnets approach \u2013\u00a0 but maybe you can remind us how you began working with IOHK?**\n\nI started as a researcher in formal methods for programming languages and distributed systems. But I wanted to build systems actually used by many, so I moved into the industry where I notably worked on proving the correctness of a centralized payment protocol and creating an airline reservation system. After a few years at Google and Bridgewater, I decided life wasn\u2019t worth working under dysfunctional hierarchies, so I started my own cryptocurrency companies. Charles invited me to speak at the IOHK Summit 2019, and I realized how much I like the Cardano community: we have a similar focus on building robust software for the long term. That is why I wanted to port my domain specific language Glow to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Tell us a bit why you started your company Mutual Knowledge Systems, or as you call it MuKn (Moon)?**\n\nOver three years ago, I was reviewing whitepapers. Most papers (about \u00be) had interesting techniques but made no economic sense. Most of the rest (about \u2155) made economic sense but had no technical content. Only the top few (about 5%) actually made sense both technically and economically. At some point, I realized I could do better, so I designed a scaling solution using lessons learned from working on Tezos. Arthur Breitman challenged me to use smart contracts instead of trying to modify his protocol. \n\nWhile trying to prove his challenge absurd, I instead found that he was right and I was wrong\u2014and I finally understood why and how to use smart contracts. I started a company around the resulting scaling solution, raised money, pivoted into building the scaling solution after the language capable of generating it from specification, fought with and fired my then-partner, became my own CEO, started a new company, and, after much struggle, finally found the right founding team. Together, we built Mutual Knowledge Systems around this new programming language, Glow\u2014designed to be much better than existing languages to write decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n**When you say \u2018better\u2019, what do you really mean?**\n\nWriting a DApp is the single hardest thing to do in the world. This is because you can\u2019t afford a mistake, or your users may lose significant funds. Furthermore, you are not confronting random situations, but active adversaries bent on attacking your code, who will contrive the very worst case scenarios to exploit for their profit. Yet, unlike the military, you can\u2019t hide your code or protect access to your networks: all the critical pieces are necessarily public. On top of that, extant programming tools are not designed for these constraints and even traditional formal methods lack essential concepts to express the issues at stake.\n\nThus, we decided to make new tools fit for the challenge. Our domain-specific language (DSL) drastically simplifies DApp development, by abstracting away all the common blockchain infrastructure, so you can focus on your problem domain (trading, derivatives, insurance, supply chain, etc.). Your DApps can be thousands of lines of code that your users can afford to audit, instead of millions of lines of code that require leaps of blind faith. And the programming model will enable developers, auditors and automated verification tools to reason at the level of abstraction of participants exchanging assets, rather than at that of packets of bytes shipped around the Internet.\n\n\n\n**What is it about Cardano and its community that appeals?**\n\nI started like everyone else, on Ethereum, because its ecosystem is already mature. However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s got great fundamentals.\n\n\n\n**Can you talk about how you hope Glow will change the DApp developer experience?**\n\nGlow is portable. Today it works on Cardano and Ethereum but in the future it will work with any blockchain that is sufficiently advanced to support smart contracts. That means that you can write your DApp once and it will run on whichever platform has the users and the liquidity you seek. You don\u2019t have to make a guess about where liquidity will be in the future then sink heavy investments to develop on a single chain that you bet your house on.\n\n\n\nWith Glow, developers can run their DApps on all blockchains. Glow will commoditize blockchains. Blockchains will then compete on technical and economic merits, not on user lock-in and inertia. And the value brought to users will increase.\n\n\n\n**What can the community expect from Glow?**\n\nWe have launched this early version of Glow on the Cardano EVM Devnet with a command-line interface. In many ways, it is not yet ready for use by end-users, but it can already demonstrate simple applications. Users can also see how they may write a 6 line application in Glow that would require hundreds of lines in a combination of Solidity and JavaScript. We have a roadmap over the next few months to add a lot of features: from ERC20 tokens (and, on Cardano, native tokens), to generalized state channels, to a web interface, to a more robust runtime, etc. Eventually, we want to become the development environment for all blockchain projects. And Glow is of course an open source software open to the community.\n\n**We\u2019re rolling out the integration with Glow with our EVM and devnet program, so what are some of the benefits of this?**\n\nThe Cardano EVM side-chain will enable arbitrary contracts to run on Cardano that use the mature EVM platform, without waiting for Plutus to deliver its promise, to achieve feature-parity, to be considered stable, etc. And Glow can run on this EVM side-chain and provide the simplicity, safety and portability in DApp development that were not available before.\n\n**What is the rollout process like and how can our community get involved if they want to?**\n\nGlow is still in development. There are some things that it can do already and some it can\u2019t do yet. We invite DApp developers to join the Glow community and use the language for what it can already do, and otherwise help us build the blockchain development environment of the future. You can build the missing features you need yourself, or contract MuKn to build them for you. Even if you can\u2019t code and have no budget, you can help write the documentation, or even just tell us where it isn\u2019t clear yet, or what features you need most so we know what to prioritize. Together, we can build great DApps that you just couldn\u2019t have achieved safely and within budget with previous tools.\n\n*If you\u2019re a developer, we encourage you to get involved with [Mutual Knowledge Systems and Glow](https://mukn.io/).

In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Decentralizing social media: a conversation with Ben Goertzel and Charles Hoskinson", "subtitle": "The minds behind SingularityNET and Cardano come together to explore a vision of the future of decentralization, AI, and social media.", "audio": null, "soundcloud": null, "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\n*At the end of 2020, we announced our collaboration with SingularityNET, in an exclusive [fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3O5F_CCT8c) between Charles Hoskinson and SingularityNET founder & CEO, Ben Goertzel.*\u00a0\n\n*SingularityNET recently shared further information on the partnership when they announced their exciting [Phase Two initiative](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a),* [](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a) *which includes a shift from Ethereum to Cardano, to achieve new network functionalities and launching a Stream of New AGI-ADA Tokens.*\n\n*Last week, Charles and Ben sat down again together in a special [SingularityNET podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNWJGGc7ESI). In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "decentralizing-social-media", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/02/05/decentralizing-social-media/", "read_time": 57}, {"publish_date": "2021-01-06T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/344fa779-3928-4439-870f-7977abbfec51/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": " Project Catalyst blasts off into 2021 ", "subtitle": "New fund will commit $500k in ada to find groundbreaking ideas which accelerate Cardano development", "audio": "", "soundcloud": [{"trackid": 987296944}], "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\nProject Catalyst is the first stage in our Voltaire roadmap, created to bring best-in-class governance to Cardano.

This has led us to collaborating with global leaders in technology, business and finance. Now, we\u2019re pleased to announce a new partnership with Wolfram. As a part of this relationship, Cardano data will be integrated into the Wolfram Alpha computational intelligence engine. This places Cardano alongside Ethereum and the Bitcoin as blockchain data to be included within Wolfram Alpha.\n\n\n\nWolfram and IOHK have historically enjoyed close ties, with Stephen Wolfram presenting at\u00a0[\\#Cardano2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h94VrSuPFJc&t=17s) as well as at the IOHK Miami 2019 summit. The company has consistently proven itself to be a leader in pushing open source intelligence across a variety of fields including computation, mathematics, and now, blockchain technology. The inclusion of Cardano data into Wolfram Alpha is a landmark moment for IOHK, but it is just the beginning of our collaboration.\n\n\n\nWe are currently defining a scope of work which would leverage Wolfram Alpha to provide Oracle services for Cardano. Oracles are a crucial component of powering smart contracts. They allow data to be transported from a variety of sources into the blockchain. This information can be anything from election results and sports scores to currency exchange rates and statistical data. This greatly expands Cardano\u2019s ability to offer new ways for developers to integrate advanced external information into their smart contacts.\n\n\n\nAs a part of this ongoing roll out IOHK will also work closely with Wolfram Blockchain Labs. Wolfram Blockchain Labs provides blockchain ecosystems with necessary tools to assist in DLT-based commerce and business innovation. The educational teams at IOHK and Wolfram will collaborate to provide Cardano-specific course material. This will help draw developers and users into the Cardano ecosystem by promoting understanding of the platform.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIntegrating with Wolfram Alpha also boasts industry leading natural language processing capabilities. This makes Cardano\u2019s information available to virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri. Once integrated, users will be able to query the system to find information or solve computational problems as easily as asking their virtual assistant. We anticipate the initial phases of integration with Wolfram will occur Q2/Q3 of next year.\n\n\n\nIOHK and Wolfram are currently building out a collaborative framework, so we\u2019ll have lots more to share over the months ahead. Meanwhile, if you would like to hear more about the partnership between Wolfram and Cardano, check out our interview with Wolfram Blockchain Labs\u2019 (WBL) Jon Woodard on December\u2019s monthly [Cardano product update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32A3878DLnk&feature=youtu.be).\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": " IOHK partners with Wolfram to power Cardano", "subtitle": "Cardano joins Bitcoin and Ethereum in integrating into Wolfram\u2019s industry leading technology and knowledge base, Wolfram Alpha.

As a part of this relationship, Cardano data will be integrated into the Wolfram Alpha computational intelligence engine. This places Cardano alongside Ethereum and the Bitcoin as blockchain data to be included within Wolfram Alpha.\n\n\n\nWolfram and IOHK have historically enjoyed close ties, with Stephen Wolfram presenting at\u00a0[\\#Cardano2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h94VrSuPFJc&t=17s) as well as at the IOHK Miami 2019 summit. The company has consistently proven itself to be a leader in pushing open source intelligence across a variety of fields including computation, mathematics, and now, blockchain technology. The inclusion of Cardano data into Wolfram Alpha is a landmark moment for IOHK, but it is just the beginning of our collaboration.\n\n\n\nWe are currently defining a scope of work which would leverage Wolfram Alpha to provide Oracle services for Cardano. Oracles are a crucial component of powering smart contracts. They allow data to be transported from a variety of sources into the blockchain. This information can be anything from election results and sports scores to currency exchange rates and statistical data. This greatly expands Cardano\u2019s ability to offer new ways for developers to integrate advanced external information into their smart contacts.\n\n\n\nAs a part of this ongoing roll out IOHK will also work closely with Wolfram Blockchain Labs. Wolfram Blockchain Labs provides blockchain ecosystems with necessary tools to assist in DLT-based commerce and business innovation. The educational teams at IOHK and Wolfram will collaborate to provide Cardano-specific course material. This will help draw developers and users into the Cardano ecosystem by promoting understanding of the platform.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIntegrating with Wolfram Alpha also boasts industry leading natural language processing capabilities. This makes Cardano\u2019s information available to virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri. Once integrated, users will be able to query the system to find information or solve computational problems as easily as asking their virtual assistant. We anticipate the initial phases of integration with Wolfram will occur Q2/Q3 of next year.\n\n\n\nIOHK and Wolfram are currently building out a collaborative framework, so we\u2019ll have lots more to share over the months ahead. Meanwhile, if you would like to hear more about the partnership between Wolfram and Cardano, check out our interview with Wolfram Blockchain Labs\u2019 (WBL) Jon Woodard on December\u2019s monthly [Cardano product update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32A3878DLnk&feature=youtu.be).\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "iohk-partners-with-wolfram-to-power-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2020/12/17/iohk-partners-with-wolfram-to-power-cardano/", "read_time": 2}, {"publish_date": "2020-10-06T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/0b407539-3d27-4de5-a711-06e1626dcbd8/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Developer challenge: using blockchain to support the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals", "subtitle": "IOHK has set up a $10,000 fund to invest in ideas for sustainable development based on Cardano.", "audio": null, "soundcloud": null, "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\nCreating a decentralized financial and social operating system for the world is the core mission of Cardano. But it\u2019s not one that we can accomplish alone. That\u2019s why we are always on the lookout for relationships which help us build a global foundation for growth. So, we\u2019re thrilled to announce our hackathon challenge to support the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals (SDGs) designed to accelerate progress on fighting hunger, injustice, and climate change.\n\n## Sustainability and blockchain\n\nIn this hackathon challenge we aim to give the blockchain community an opportunity to make an impact on international development. The challenge will draw on IOHK\u2019s expertise in community-focused funding developed with Project Catalyst. This initiative brings innovation, voting, and decentralized funding to Cardano by crowdsourcing development proposals, and financing their implementation.\n\nIOHK and United Nations personnel will use the Project Catalyst platform to find and fund initiatives that align with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. These goals were adopted by 193 world leaders in 2015. Each of the 17 targets focus on ending extreme poverty and hunger, fighting inequality and injustice, and tackling climate change by 2030.\n\nThis IOHK-sponsored challenge hopes to promote projects based in the digitization of finance which increase the efficacy and transparency of funding for the UN\u2019s Decade of Action. In the run-up to the 2030 deadline for achieving the global sustainability goals, the UN is marking 75 years since its establishment. Given that the transnational organization works on global collective action problems it has engaged with blockchain technology as a solution.\n\n## Crowdsourcing the future\n\nParticipants in the program can put forward ideas focused on any of the 17 goals. To encourage participation, IOHK is sponsoring a prize fund of ada worth $10,000 as well as ongoing support to bring the projects to fruition. Proposals will be judged by a panel of IOHK and UN employees. They will determine the winners based on an idea\u2019s technical prowess, scalability and social impact, as well as its financial and volunteer support. The winning ideas will be able to seek the advice of experts from both the UN and IOHK to ensure that they are implemented in the most impactful way.\n\nTo qualify for the scheme, entries must be open source and be created for use on the Cardano blockchain. Example code should be written in Marlowe, a domain specific language developed for financial contracts on Cardano. These do not need to be fully coded submissions. Instead they can be ideas which inspire anyone to get involved with blockchain technology and sustainable development. The proposal submission period opens on Saturday October 10th. Participants must be registered by then in order to submit. Entries must be finalized by October 18 at 11:59 MDT. Make sure to check the [official rules](https://static.iohk.io/docs/IOHK_UN_challenge.pdf) to learn more.\n\nWinners will be announced on October 24, United Nations Day, which marks the anniversary of the charter of the organization. We encourage everyone with an interest in using Cardano to achieve sustainability goals to get involved.

Every presentation, panel and guest speaker at this online event, has been chosen to represent the many faces of Cardano. From world-class foundational research to the latest advances in cryptographic development; from the passion and dedication of the wider community to some of the innovators who have created our world and are lighting the path to the future. The event is meant to honor the hard work and dedication of the Cardano community, developers and contributors, and the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe virtual summit, much like IOHK\u2019s 2019 Miami summit will include presentations from IOHK team members, special guest appearances by thought leaders and a keynote speech by IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson. We were proud to announce that our guest of honor is internet co-creator and lead internet evangelist for Google, Vint Cerf. As one of the lead architects of the internet Vint is uniquely positioned to give us insight into building world changing technology.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be joined by Caitlin Long of the Wyoming Blockchain Select Committee. The Wall Street professional turned crypto pioneer has been blazing the trail for adoption in the state of Wyoming. She will give us a look at the challenges and opportunities she has faced while pushing for wider adoption of decentralization. Our final special guest, Stephen Wolfram is the creator of the computational knowledge platform Wolfram Alpha and the CEO of Wolfram Research. Cardano shares his dedication to advancing technology through open source research and a commitment to academic excellence. Between each of these important discussions our colleagues at IOHK will take center stage.\n\n## Thought leadership\n\nIOHK\u2019s chief scientist, Aggelos Kiayias, and director of African operations John O\u2019Connor will talk about research and outreach in the Cardano Blockchain. Our panel entitled \u2018Haskell, then, now, and the future\u2019 will examine the impact the functional programming language has had and where it is heading. The virtual summit also serves as the launchpad for new advancements like \u2018Prism\u2019 our decentralized identity solution. More guest speakers will be announced over the week ahead and we\u2019ll also have a number of special announcements over the 2-day summit itself; we\u2019re keeping those under our hats until then.\n\nThe two day [agenda](https://cardanosummit.iohk.io/images/virtual-summit-agenda.pdf) includes five digital stages with programs dedicated to the ideology of blockchain technology; the science of decentralization, and building distributed ledgers for business and enterprise. We will be discussing next steps for growing the Cardano community alongside oncoming blockchain regulations, governance, and opportunities. In combination, we hope the summit tracks will offer something for anyone interested in the future of Cardano, by the science and ideas that surround it, by the great minds making it all happen and by the incredible community that has brought us here and will take us forward.\n\nSessions will encompass the philosophical as well as the technical. Brian Behlendorf, the CEO of the Hyperledger Consortium will form part of a panel focused on the importance of open source development. IOHK recently [joined](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/11/why-we-are-joining-hyperledger/) the Hyperledger Consortium, to better exploit our common vision of a future made better through shared knowledge. Following on the philosophy track, artificial intelligence researcher, Ben Goertzel will speak on the intersection of AI and decentralized technology. We hope to announce more exciting sessions in the days leading up to the event. At the end of the day, building the next generation of technology means bringing the best minds of many fields into the same room, even if it\u2019s a virtual one.\n\n## Building community\n\nThe Cardano Virtual Summit 2020: Shelley Edition, won\u2019t be all work and no play. The Covid crisis has forced every conference online in past months. While we can\u2019t recreate the full physical conference experience in the virtual space, we\u2019re keen to provide some of the networking and downtime opportunities you might expect. So we\u2019ve added a virtual \u2018chill-out\u2019 zone, with guided meditations, a DJ set, and even an online calligraphy lesson/demonstration. Our virtual platform will allow attendees to enjoy the digital expo space through avatars. We\u2019ll even get the conversation flowing with a digital Shelley cocktail \u2018happy hour\u2019 between meetings.\n\nRecent events have made it difficult to meet in person but we see The Cardano Virtual Summit as an opportunity to invite everyone from around the world to participate. Attendance for anyone interested in the summit is absolutely free of charge. To join in, simply [reserve](https://www.ubivent.com/register/cardanovirtualsummit) your spot.\n\nShelley is the culmination of over 5 years of research and development, the creation of a multi-disciplinary team and a remarkable community. The virtual summit is just a single point of time \u2013 a time to take stock, reflect and celebrate. But it marks just the start of a groundbreaking new era of decentralization, growth and adoption.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Bringing the community together for the Cardano Virtual Summit 2020: Shelley Edition", "subtitle": "Celebrating the journey and making way for the future with IOHK", "audio": null, "soundcloud": null, "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\nShelley has arrived and IOHK is gearing up to celebrate with the [Cardano Virtual Summit 2020: Shelley Edition](https://cardanosummit.iohk.io/) on July 2nd and 3rd.

To get started, check out the Adrestia project [repo](https://github.com/input-output-hk/adrestia) and read the[ user guide](https://input-output-hk.github.io/adrestia/).\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "integrating-and-advancing-with-adrestia", "url": "/blog/posts/2020/06/15/integrating-and-advancing-with-adrestia/", "read_time": 4}, {"publish_date": "2020-04-07", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/7ff3d68c-a443-44ae-b104-a74a1a686d78/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Architecting Shelley: an interview with Duncan Coutts", "subtitle": "A fireside chat with Duncan Coutts, Cardano's chief technical architect, about Haskell and delivering Shelley", "audio": null, "soundcloud": null, "body_content": "Duncan Coutts has been an important guide on the road to the Cardano Shelley mainnet. Long time supporters of IOHK are likely familiar with his signature long hair, beard, and penchant for drinking tea while discussing decentralization in front of a [white board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZGVgNsJSnA&t=572s). He recently sat down for an interview to discuss the upcoming Byron reboot, the Haskell Shelley testnet, and the conclusion of the pre-Shelley development cycle. Coutts, who has been working with IOHK since 2016, brings a wealth of knowledge from working with the Haskell programming language for nearly 20 years and helping found the Well-Typed consultancy.\n\n**What\u2019s your role at IOHK?**\n\nI\u2019m the chief technical architect for the Cardano project and I\u2019m primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the node. This means that I collaborate with the teams that work on consensus, ledger, networking, and other things. Ultimately, I work to bring everyone together around the same design after a discussion with the team leaders. The design of Cardano is the product of joint work by many individuals working together.\n\n**What does the Haskell programming language bring to Cardano?**\n\nHaskell is an enabler. It makes it easier for us to follow the approach that we believe is right, which is driven by computer science. We know how to do things properly; computer science tells us how. We just need to pick the appropriate techniques to do that. Haskell makes that easier.\n\nIt\u2019s a good fit for Cardano because it suits the high-assurance, specification-driven software that is vital for a blockchain. Haskell helps us find systematic ways of avoiding mistakes. In essence, it\u2019s a better mousetrap.\n\n**You\u2019ve been working with Haskell for a long time. How have you seen the landscape of functional programming change?**\n\nPeople take it seriously now. When I started as an undergraduate in 1999, I thought that Haskell was amazing. Other students thought, \u2018Wow that\u2019s totally impractical. How will you ever get a job?\u2019\n\nAt the time, functional programming was an academic curiosity. There wasn\u2019t any prebuilt code and it wasn\u2019t machine readable, which meant that Haskell wasn\u2019t usable for a wide range of people. There wasn\u2019t the tooling, range of libraries, or experience. That has changed over the years: the tooling got better, the libraries got better. IOHK has helped develop the infrastructure for building and distributing open-source Haskell code and the number of libraries exploded. That, combined with more teaching and a gradual change of attitude in the industry, means that people take it more seriously now. Haskell hasn\u2019t changed as much as the industry around us has.\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest change from an industry point of view?**\n\nThere are two things. The first is that attitudes are changing, albeit slowly. People are changing their opinions about what they consider a sensible language choice. Previously, everything had to be in C or Java or maybe Python, but eventually good ideas make progress, even if it takes a long time. You can make a lot of progress by just recognizing that a good idea is a good idea. The mainstream does pick up on important developments, even if it does take 10 or 15 years. The industry has not embraced functional programming wholesale yet, but individual programmers have taken up various ideas. That makes Haskell look less radical.\n\nIf you look at a language like Rust, it has some of the clever type systems of Haskell, although it doesn\u2019t have any functional programming ideas. Even Java and C++ have some functional programming ideas in them these days, so Haskell is not quite so far from the mainstream as it used to be.\n\nThe second major change has been performance, which is getting much better. We\u2019ve recently become competitive with Java in terms of performance. It makes people say, \u2018Wow, Haskell is so fast,\u2019 but that\u2019s because they\u2019re comparing it to Python and PHP rather than C. So that\u2019s another way of saying that Haskell has improved slightly, but the industry environment around it has changed as well.\n\n**You have been heavily involved in the Byron reboot which was kicked off last week. Why was this work important?**\n\nThe [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/) is the culmination of over 18 months of hard work across multiple IOHK development teams, and constitutes a complete overhaul of the node infrastructure with 100% fresh code. The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself. The Byron reboot will go a long way to improving things, and users should see Daedalus syncing and restoring wallets within minutes, even when downloading the entire Cardano blockchain.\n\n**As the chief architect, your job is to lay the foundation for Cardano\u2019s future. What have you focused on to achieve this?**\n\nThe most important aspect in terms of flexibility for the future is keeping different functions separate. One of the big improvements of the Byron reboot is that the ledger rules will be totally independent of the consensus implementation; this modularity means that the ledger rules are perfectly clean mathematical functions, which is a core aspect of functional programming.\n\nAs a result, everything is easier to test, tweak, and change, both now and in the future. The consensus algorithm isn\u2019t entangled with the details of the ledger rules, so we can alter the ledger rules without changing the consensus implementation. This makes integrating Plutus and smart contracts functionality much easier and will also help in the future when we are adding treasury and governance features.\n\nThe consensus implementation itself has also been parameterized so that we can transition from the Ouroboros Classic consensus protocol to BFT and then Praos, which also provides flexibility for future versions of the protocol that haven't been developed yet.\n\n**Shelley is a big step towards the future of Cardano, but what is the significance of compiling Haskell into JavaScript and WebAssembly?**\n\nWe\u2019re interested in compiling to JavaScript or WebAssembly because of Plutus. We want to have Plutus contracts or Plutus applications that can be distributed to users, which would include custom interfaces and custom logic with the user rather than in a server. Compiling to JavaScript allows us to do that; you can compile the Plutus code once and distribute it to users on different platforms.\n\n- - -\n\nThanks to Duncan Coutts for his time.

Plutus is no different.

By using Plutus to write smart contracts on the Cardano network, developers benefit from all of the above, as well as the ability to use the same language for both on and off-chain code.\n\nWhile developers will have to wait for the Goguen era to launch smart contracts on the Cardano network, they can begin testing their smart contract skills in the [Plutus Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/plutus/tools/playground/ \"Plutus Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"). IOHK has also created a [Plutus ebook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plutus-Writing-reliable-smart-contracts-ebook/dp/B07V46LWTW \"Plutus ebook, amazon.com\") and [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/ \"Plutus Udemy course, udemy.com\") to help developers hit the ground running once Plutus is available on the Cardano mainnet.\n\n## And bringing Plutus to everyone with Marlowe\n\nThe problem with smart contracts, however, is that sometimes the people who know how to write the code don\u2019t have the industry expertise to know how to structure the contracts themselves. Enter Marlowe, IOHK\u2019s domain-specific language (DSL). Marlowe is designed for use by anyone that wants to write a financial smart contract without the programming skills to implement it. Users can try out Marlowe via the [Marlowe Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/marlowe/get-started/sample-marlowe-smart-contracts/ \"Marlowe Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"), a web utility with a user-friendly GUI and drag and drop components, where they can create financial smart contracts which, when complete, will generate fully-functional, implementation-ready Plutus code.\n\nMarlowe gives anyone the ability to gain familiarity with smart contracts while protecting them from unexpected outcomes.

These make certain that both parties have dedicated funds in the agreement while ensuring that money will not be left in the system after a contract has concluded.\n\n## Laying solid foundations\n\nPlutus, Marlowe, and the Cardano ecosystem continue to evolve to provide the safest and most efficient conditions to build decentralized applications. The next generations of Plutus and Marlowe will be announced at the WyoHackathon at the University of Wyoming on September 20, ahead of their release on mainnet at the start of the Goguen era. Marlowe advances include a high-fidelity development system that aids the writing of executable contracts and the new iteration of Plutus will allow users to access their contracts from web or mobile applications.

But why Wyoming?\n\n\n\nThe blockchain revolution in Wyoming is the result of a series of laws and regulations passed within its borders. These key pieces of legislation include exemptions from money transmitting laws for virtual assets, as well as a blockchain \u2018sandbox\u2019 bill that would allow decentralized businesses to operate free from the red tape encountered elsewhere in the US. The state is also home to the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, headed by former Wall Street corporate financier Caitlin Long, which has worked to make Wyoming the standard-bearer of blockchain in the country.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, IOHK relocated its headquarters to Wyoming to take advantage of the state\u2019s legislative embracing of distributed ledger technology, making it the biggest decentralized company in the state. As a result, IOHK has become a nexus for developers, crypto enthusiasts, businesses, and government officials in the area. Events like the 2019 WyoHackathon bring these groups together to advance the cutting edge of blockchain innovation.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re thrilled to welcome the Cardano community to this special event in IOHK\u2019s home state,\u2019 says Caitlin Long. The event has also inspired a group of high school students from a remote part of Wyoming to make the journey to participate in the hackathon and meet IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson. \u2018There is something special building between the University of Wyoming computer science department and Cardano!\u2019 she adds.\n\n\n\nThe hackathon will see hundreds of developers participating in workshops, presenting papers, and acquainting themselves with new technology. Charles Hoskinson and Cardano\u2019s senior product manager David Esser will be among the speakers at the event, alongside prominent leaders in the blockchain industry such as Jesse Powell of Kraken and Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital. September marks the second anniversary of the Cardano project and is a milestone for IOHK, with several major advances to Cardano being delivered. Plutus engineers Jann M\u00fcller and Michael Peyton Jones will be at the event to explain how work on Cardano is progressing to create the ideal environment for smart contract development and execution.\n\n\n\nLast but certainly not least, the next iteration of the Plutus framework will be released during the hackathon. Plutus is a functional programming language and smart contract platform that allows developers of all kinds to launch smart contracts on the Cardano network. While Ethereum paved the way for programmable blockchains, it also has some significant barriers to entry. IOHK aims to bring greater scalability, sustainability, and interoperability to the crypto sphere by allowing anyone to build on a distributed ledger. Ultimately, it is developers that will build the businesses which will solve local and international problems.

But why Wyoming?\n\n\n\nThe blockchain revolution in Wyoming is the result of a series of laws and regulations passed within its borders. These key pieces of legislation include exemptions from money transmitting laws for virtual assets, as well as a blockchain \u2018sandbox\u2019 bill that would allow decentralized businesses to operate free from the red tape encountered elsewhere in the US. The state is also home to the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, headed by former Wall Street corporate financier Caitlin Long, which has worked to make Wyoming the standard-bearer of blockchain in the country.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, IOHK relocated its headquarters to Wyoming to take advantage of the state\u2019s legislative embracing of distributed ledger technology, making it the biggest decentralized company in the state. As a result, IOHK has become a nexus for developers, crypto enthusiasts, businesses, and government officials in the area. Events like the 2019 WyoHackathon bring these groups together to advance the cutting edge of blockchain innovation.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re thrilled to welcome the Cardano community to this special event in IOHK\u2019s home state,\u2019 says Caitlin Long. The event has also inspired a group of high school students from a remote part of Wyoming to make the journey to participate in the hackathon and meet IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson. \u2018There is something special building between the University of Wyoming computer science department and Cardano!\u2019 she adds.\n\n\n\nThe hackathon will see hundreds of developers participating in workshops, presenting papers, and acquainting themselves with new technology. Charles Hoskinson and Cardano\u2019s senior product manager David Esser will be among the speakers at the event, alongside prominent leaders in the blockchain industry such as Jesse Powell of Kraken and Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital. September marks the second anniversary of the Cardano project and is a milestone for IOHK, with several major advances to Cardano being delivered. Plutus engineers Jann M\u00fcller and Michael Peyton Jones will be at the event to explain how work on Cardano is progressing to create the ideal environment for smart contract development and execution.\n\n\n\nLast but certainly not least, the next iteration of the Plutus framework will be released during the hackathon. Plutus is a functional programming language and smart contract platform that allows developers of all kinds to launch smart contracts on the Cardano network. While Ethereum paved the way for programmable blockchains, it also has some significant barriers to entry. IOHK aims to bring greater scalability, sustainability, and interoperability to the crypto sphere by allowing anyone to build on a distributed ledger. Ultimately, it is developers that will build the businesses which will solve local and international problems. Plutus was created to enable those developers, and is supported by an IOHK-created \\[programming book](https://www.amazon.com/Plutus-Writing-reliable-smart-contracts-ebook/dp/B07V46LWTW \"Plutus ebook on Amazon, amazon.com\").\n\n\n\nBoth Wyoming and IOHK have aligned their interests in supporting the next generation of thinkers in distributed ledger technology.

Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

This week, building on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://developers.cardano.org/en/virtual-machines/welcome/), we\u2019re rolling out a new [development environment](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/) to support the Glow language.*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau of Mutual Knowledge Systems is the creator of Glow, a DSL that will allow anyone to write verifiable DApps from a single spec and deploy it on our EVM network.

The following is a distillation of his thoughts from our previous interviews.*\n\n\n\n**We first introduced the community to GLOW and MuKn at the end of [last year](https://youtu.be/lj9SlvOIBgU?t=2902) when we announced our devnets approach \u2013\u00a0 but maybe you can remind us how you began working with IOHK?**\n\nI started as a researcher in formal methods for programming languages and distributed systems. But I wanted to build systems actually used by many, so I moved into the industry where I notably worked on proving the correctness of a centralized payment protocol and creating an airline reservation system. After a few years at Google and Bridgewater, I decided life wasn\u2019t worth working under dysfunctional hierarchies, so I started my own cryptocurrency companies. Charles invited me to speak at the IOHK Summit 2019, and I realized how much I like the Cardano community: we have a similar focus on building robust software for the long term. That is why I wanted to port my domain specific language Glow to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Tell us a bit why you started your company Mutual Knowledge Systems, or as you call it MuKn (Moon)?**\n\nOver three years ago, I was reviewing whitepapers. Most papers (about \u00be) had interesting techniques but made no economic sense. Most of the rest (about \u2155) made economic sense but had no technical content. Only the top few (about 5%) actually made sense both technically and economically. At some point, I realized I could do better, so I designed a scaling solution using lessons learned from working on Tezos. Arthur Breitman challenged me to use smart contracts instead of trying to modify his protocol. \n\nWhile trying to prove his challenge absurd, I instead found that he was right and I was wrong\u2014and I finally understood why and how to use smart contracts. I started a company around the resulting scaling solution, raised money, pivoted into building the scaling solution after the language capable of generating it from specification, fought with and fired my then-partner, became my own CEO, started a new company, and, after much struggle, finally found the right founding team. Together, we built Mutual Knowledge Systems around this new programming language, Glow\u2014designed to be much better than existing languages to write decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n**When you say \u2018better\u2019, what do you really mean?**\n\nWriting a DApp is the single hardest thing to do in the world. This is because you can\u2019t afford a mistake, or your users may lose significant funds. Furthermore, you are not confronting random situations, but active adversaries bent on attacking your code, who will contrive the very worst case scenarios to exploit for their profit. Yet, unlike the military, you can\u2019t hide your code or protect access to your networks: all the critical pieces are necessarily public. On top of that, extant programming tools are not designed for these constraints and even traditional formal methods lack essential concepts to express the issues at stake.\n\nThus, we decided to make new tools fit for the challenge. Our domain-specific language (DSL) drastically simplifies DApp development, by abstracting away all the common blockchain infrastructure, so you can focus on your problem domain (trading, derivatives, insurance, supply chain, etc.). Your DApps can be thousands of lines of code that your users can afford to audit, instead of millions of lines of code that require leaps of blind faith. And the programming model will enable developers, auditors and automated verification tools to reason at the level of abstraction of participants exchanging assets, rather than at that of packets of bytes shipped around the Internet.\n\n\n\n**What is it about Cardano and its community that appeals?**\n\nI started like everyone else, on Ethereum, because its ecosystem is already mature. However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s got great fundamentals.\n\n\n\n**Can you talk about how you hope Glow will change the DApp developer experience?**\n\nGlow is portable. Today it works on Cardano and Ethereum but in the future it will work with any blockchain that is sufficiently advanced to support smart contracts. That means that you can write your DApp once and it will run on whichever platform has the users and the liquidity you seek. You don\u2019t have to make a guess about where liquidity will be in the future then sink heavy investments to develop on a single chain that you bet your house on.\n\n\n\nWith Glow, developers can run their DApps on all blockchains. Glow will commoditize blockchains. Blockchains will then compete on technical and economic merits, not on user lock-in and inertia. And the value brought to users will increase.\n\n\n\n**What can the community expect from Glow?**\n\nWe have launched this early version of Glow on the Cardano EVM Devnet with a command-line interface. In many ways, it is not yet ready for use by end-users, but it can already demonstrate simple applications. Users can also see how they may write a 6 line application in Glow that would require hundreds of lines in a combination of Solidity and JavaScript. We have a roadmap over the next few months to add a lot of features: from ERC20 tokens (and, on Cardano, native tokens), to generalized state channels, to a web interface, to a more robust runtime, etc. Eventually, we want to become the development environment for all blockchain projects. And Glow is of course an open source software open to the community.\n\n**We\u2019re rolling out the integration with Glow with our EVM and devnet program, so what are some of the benefits of this?**\n\nThe Cardano EVM side-chain will enable arbitrary contracts to run on Cardano that use the mature EVM platform, without waiting for Plutus to deliver its promise, to achieve feature-parity, to be considered stable, etc. And Glow can run on this EVM side-chain and provide the simplicity, safety and portability in DApp development that were not available before.\n\n**What is the rollout process like and how can our community get involved if they want to?**\n\nGlow is still in development. There are some things that it can do already and some it can\u2019t do yet. We invite DApp developers to join the Glow community and use the language for what it can already do, and otherwise help us build the blockchain development environment of the future. You can build the missing features you need yourself, or contract MuKn to build them for you. Even if you can\u2019t code and have no budget, you can help write the documentation, or even just tell us where it isn\u2019t clear yet, or what features you need most so we know what to prioritize. Together, we can build great DApps that you just couldn\u2019t have achieved safely and within budget with previous tools.\n\n*If you\u2019re a developer, we encourage you to get involved with [Mutual Knowledge Systems and Glow](https://mukn.io/).

In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great.

Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "decentralizing-social-media", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/02/05/decentralizing-social-media/", "read_time": 57}, {"publish_date": "2021-01-06T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/344fa779-3928-4439-870f-7977abbfec51/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": " Project Catalyst blasts off into 2021 ", "subtitle": "New fund will commit $500k in ada to find groundbreaking ideas which accelerate Cardano development", "audio": "", "soundcloud": [{"trackid": 987296944}], "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\nProject Catalyst is the first stage in our Voltaire roadmap, created to bring best-in-class governance to Cardano. Effective governance is vital to Cardano because it gives the power to shape the blockchain to its users. Anyone who signs up to Catalyst will be able to propose ideas, and then registered ada holders will vote on funding proposals focused on the continued evolution of Cardano as a platform and a community. This will not only accelerate development but also sustain the Cardano ecosystem in the long term.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis journey began with two test funds, and then Catalyst swung into action for real with [Fund2 in September](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/09/16/project-catalyst-introducing-our-first-public-fund-for-cardano-community-innovation/). With it we saw a very early \u2013 and remarkable \u2013 example of decentralized collaboration. Thousands of people came together \u2013 proposing teams, community advisers and ada-holding voters \u2013 to generate, refine and prioritize funding for proposals to drive Cardano forward.\n\n\n\nVoting on Fund2 has just concluded and tallying of the votes is under way. Soon, the winning teams will receive funding to help make their proposals a reality. [Join our dedicated Telegram channel for Catalyst](https://t.me/cardanocatalyst) and stay tuned to our social channels for updates on this.\n\n\n\n**Challenge accepted**\n\nMeanwhile, with barely a beat, we\u2019re moving forward with even greater purpose by harnessing the community momentum integral to Catalyst. Fund3 launches today and we want to expand the Catalyst community with every fund, encouraging ever more people to get involved.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Project Catalyst, this is how it works. Every funding round begins with a defined set of challenges. Each challenge represents an \u2018intention\u2019 by the Cardano community, a collective goal we\u2019d like to achieve \u2013 we like to talk of return on intention as the way of measuring progress for the project! Each challenge is designed to be broad enough to inspire both technical and general ideas, while being specific enough to provide focus. As long as an idea addresses a challenge and makes a strong case for meeting the intended outcome, it will be considered. So we welcome all proposals, from marketing initiatives and infrastructure development, to content production and product enhancement.\u00a0\n\n\n\nProject Catalyst relies on the ingenuity of a global network of participants so all ideas are encouraged and can always be \u2018re-entered\u2019 for future funds if they do not meet the challenge criteria at hand.\n\n\n\nFund2 contained a pool of ada worth $250,000 and Fund3 doubles that, distributing $500,000 in ada between proposers, voters, and community advisers. Fund3 has three challenges:\n\n\n\n1. **Developer ecosystem challenge:** How can we encourage developers to build on Cardano in the next six months?\n2. **DApp creation challenge:** What decentralized applications (DApps) should be funded to drive user adoption in the next six months?\n3. **\u2018Community choice\u2019 challenge:** This new category is where we ask the community itself to set one or more challenges, which will have their own funding round in Fund5. An additional $500,000 pool will be available to cover any goal the community wishes to set, whether it\u2019s about executing the community roadmap, funding content or podcasts, encouraging non-profit work or whatever else is determined to be a priority.\n\nSo how do you participate in Project Catalyst?\n\n\n\n**From sharing insights to submitting ideas**\u00a0\n\n\n\nFirst of all, anyone wishing to get involved with the project, whether as a proposer, adviser or simply a voter, should sign up to our [collaboration platform](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/index). You do not have to be an ada holder to propose an idea or take part in the discussion phase.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFund3 begins with an insight-sharing phase in which people can give their perspectives on the challenge before proposals are launched. Think of this phase as a community brainstorming forum to inspire proposers.\n\n\n\nAfter the discussion of the challenge, participants with proposals will publicly submit an initial draft.\n\n\n\n**Refining ideas, finalizing proposals and review**\n\nCommunity members will be invited to provide constructive criticism, offer suggestions, give positive affirmations in the form of \u2018kudos\u2019, and even offer to form partnerships and collaborations with proposing teams. The goal is to pool community knowledge and expertise \u2013 and Catalyst members are a diverse crew with valuable life and professional experience to offer. The following graph shows the makeup of people who signed up for Fund2:\n\n\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8LBEdMEm001aTnHnR8Kq0RPyjg_ggwT_8lPmGOPjcum8nnMg1phpEdbPYFUzhzsLX3pNqES1tR1YcQ0Pwh9XeD3sZzINuOJmlzMCPcUAXGhuMzAjbVhxhMqQWp5OTyqclOGaFJvW)\n\n\n\nAfter community feedback is given, proposers are afforded the opportunity to revise and finalize their plans.\n\nOnce proposals are ready, a group of expert reviewers, recruited as community advisers, will give a rating for how well each one addresses the challenge. After this, ada holders can register and then cast their vote. The votes, which are weighted according to the size of each voter\u2019s holding, are then counted and requested funds distributed to the winning proposals.\n\n\n\n**Looking forward**\n\nFund2 generated incredible creativity and strong proposals, some of which will soon be funded into reality. We expect even greater things from Fund3 as we start building a thriving DApp ecosystem on Cardano. We call Project Catalyst an \u2018experiment\u2019 \u2013 and we intend to encourage this spirit for some time to come. But our intent is very real and very determined. Every week that goes by presents opportunities to improve and refine this groundbreaking program for, and with, the Cardano community.\n\n\n\n*Join us in developing Cardano\u2019s on-chain governance by signing up to our [IdeaScale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) collaboration platform and our dedicated Catalyst [Telegram](https://t.me/cardanocatalyst) channel.*\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": " Project Catalyst blasts off into 2021 ", "subtitle": "New fund will commit $500k in ada to find groundbreaking ideas which accelerate Cardano development", "audio": "", "soundcloud": [{"trackid": 987296944}], "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\nProject Catalyst is the first stage in our Voltaire roadmap, created to bring best-in-class governance to Cardano. Effective governance is vital to Cardano because it gives the power to shape the blockchain to its users. Anyone who signs up to Catalyst will be able to propose ideas, and then registered ada holders will vote on funding proposals focused on the continued evolution of Cardano as a platform and a community. This will not only accelerate development but also sustain the Cardano ecosystem in the long term.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis journey began with two test funds, and then Catalyst swung into action for real with [Fund2 in September](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/09/16/project-catalyst-introducing-our-first-public-fund-for-cardano-community-innovation/). With it we saw a very early \u2013 and remarkable \u2013 example of decentralized collaboration. Thousands of people came together \u2013 proposing teams, community advisers and ada-holding voters \u2013 to generate, refine and prioritize funding for proposals to drive Cardano forward.\n\n\n\nVoting on Fund2 has just concluded and tallying of the votes is under way. Soon, the winning teams will receive funding to help make their proposals a reality. [Join our dedicated Telegram channel for Catalyst](https://t.me/cardanocatalyst) and stay tuned to our social channels for updates on this.\n\n\n\n**Challenge accepted**\n\nMeanwhile, with barely a beat, we\u2019re moving forward with even greater purpose by harnessing the community momentum integral to Catalyst. Fund3 launches today and we want to expand the Catalyst community with every fund, encouraging ever more people to get involved.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Project Catalyst, this is how it works. Every funding round begins with a defined set of challenges. Each challenge represents an \u2018intention\u2019 by the Cardano community, a collective goal we\u2019d like to achieve \u2013 we like to talk of return on intention as the way of measuring progress for the project!

Every presentation, panel and guest speaker at this online event, has been chosen to represent the many faces of Cardano. From world-class foundational research to the latest advances in cryptographic development; from the passion and dedication of the wider community to some of the innovators who have created our world and are lighting the path to the future. The event is meant to honor the hard work and dedication of the Cardano community, developers and contributors, and the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe virtual summit, much like IOHK\u2019s 2019 Miami summit will include presentations from IOHK team members, special guest appearances by thought leaders and a keynote speech by IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson. We were proud to announce that our guest of honor is internet co-creator and lead internet evangelist for Google, Vint Cerf. As one of the lead architects of the internet Vint is uniquely positioned to give us insight into building world changing technology.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be joined by Caitlin Long of the Wyoming Blockchain Select Committee. The Wall Street professional turned crypto pioneer has been blazing the trail for adoption in the state of Wyoming. She will give us a look at the challenges and opportunities she has faced while pushing for wider adoption of decentralization. Our final special guest, Stephen Wolfram is the creator of the computational knowledge platform Wolfram Alpha and the CEO of Wolfram Research. Cardano shares his dedication to advancing technology through open source research and a commitment to academic excellence. Between each of these important discussions our colleagues at IOHK will take center stage.\n\n## Thought leadership\n\nIOHK\u2019s chief scientist, Aggelos Kiayias, and director of African operations John O\u2019Connor will talk about research and outreach in the Cardano Blockchain. Our panel entitled \u2018Haskell, then, now, and the future\u2019 will examine the impact the functional programming language has had and where it is heading. The virtual summit also serves as the launchpad for new advancements like \u2018Prism\u2019 our decentralized identity solution. More guest speakers will be announced over the week ahead and we\u2019ll also have a number of special announcements over the 2-day summit itself; we\u2019re keeping those under our hats until then.\n\nThe two day [agenda](https://cardanosummit.iohk.io/images/virtual-summit-agenda.pdf) includes five digital stages with programs dedicated to the ideology of blockchain technology; the science of decentralization, and building distributed ledgers for business and enterprise. We will be discussing next steps for growing the Cardano community alongside oncoming blockchain regulations, governance, and opportunities. In combination, we hope the summit tracks will offer something for anyone interested in the future of Cardano, by the science and ideas that surround it, by the great minds making it all happen and by the incredible community that has brought us here and will take us forward.\n\nSessions will encompass the philosophical as well as the technical. Brian Behlendorf, the CEO of the Hyperledger Consortium will form part of a panel focused on the importance of open source development. IOHK recently [joined](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/11/why-we-are-joining-hyperledger/) the Hyperledger Consortium, to better exploit our common vision of a future made better through shared knowledge. Following on the philosophy track, artificial intelligence researcher, Ben Goertzel will speak on the intersection of AI and decentralized technology. We hope to announce more exciting sessions in the days leading up to the event. At the end of the day, building the next generation of technology means bringing the best minds of many fields into the same room, even if it\u2019s a virtual one.\n\n## Building community\n\nThe Cardano Virtual Summit 2020: Shelley Edition, won\u2019t be all work and no play. The Covid crisis has forced every conference online in past months. While we can\u2019t recreate the full physical conference experience in the virtual space, we\u2019re keen to provide some of the networking and downtime opportunities you might expect. So we\u2019ve added a virtual \u2018chill-out\u2019 zone, with guided meditations, a DJ set, and even an online calligraphy lesson/demonstration. Our virtual platform will allow attendees to enjoy the digital expo space through avatars. We\u2019ll even get the conversation flowing with a digital Shelley cocktail \u2018happy hour\u2019 between meetings.\n\nRecent events have made it difficult to meet in person but we see The Cardano Virtual Summit as an opportunity to invite everyone from around the world to participate. Attendance for anyone interested in the summit is absolutely free of charge.

Every presentation, panel and guest speaker at this online event, has been chosen to represent the many faces of Cardano. From world-class foundational research to the latest advances in cryptographic development; from the passion and dedication of the wider community to some of the innovators who have created our world and are lighting the path to the future. The event is meant to honor the hard work and dedication of the Cardano community, developers and contributors, and the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe virtual summit, much like IOHK\u2019s 2019 Miami summit will include presentations from IOHK team members, special guest appearances by thought leaders and a keynote speech by IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson. We were proud to announce that our guest of honor is internet co-creator and lead internet evangelist for Google, Vint Cerf. As one of the lead architects of the internet Vint is uniquely positioned to give us insight into building world changing technology.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be joined by Caitlin Long of the Wyoming Blockchain Select Committee. The Wall Street professional turned crypto pioneer has been blazing the trail for adoption in the state of Wyoming. She will give us a look at the challenges and opportunities she has faced while pushing for wider adoption of decentralization. Our final special guest, Stephen Wolfram is the creator of the computational knowledge platform Wolfram Alpha and the CEO of Wolfram Research. Cardano shares his dedication to advancing technology through open source research and a commitment to academic excellence. Between each of these important discussions our colleagues at IOHK will take center stage.\n\n## Thought leadership\n\nIOHK\u2019s chief scientist, Aggelos Kiayias, and director of African operations John O\u2019Connor will talk about research and outreach in the Cardano Blockchain. Our panel entitled \u2018Haskell, then, now, and the future\u2019 will examine the impact the functional programming language has had and where it is heading. The virtual summit also serves as the launchpad for new advancements like \u2018Prism\u2019 our decentralized identity solution. More guest speakers will be announced over the week ahead and we\u2019ll also have a number of special announcements over the 2-day summit itself; we\u2019re keeping those under our hats until then.\n\nThe two day [agenda](https://cardanosummit.iohk.io/images/virtual-summit-agenda.pdf) includes five digital stages with programs dedicated to the ideology of blockchain technology; the science of decentralization, and building distributed ledgers for business and enterprise. We will be discussing next steps for growing the Cardano community alongside oncoming blockchain regulations, governance, and opportunities. In combination, we hope the summit tracks will offer something for anyone interested in the future of Cardano, by the science and ideas that surround it, by the great minds making it all happen and by the incredible community that has brought us here and will take us forward.\n\nSessions will encompass the philosophical as well as the technical. Brian Behlendorf, the CEO of the Hyperledger Consortium will form part of a panel focused on the importance of open source development. IOHK recently [joined](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/11/why-we-are-joining-hyperledger/) the Hyperledger Consortium, to better exploit our common vision of a future made better through shared knowledge. Following on the philosophy track, artificial intelligence researcher, Ben Goertzel will speak on the intersection of AI and decentralized technology. We hope to announce more exciting sessions in the days leading up to the event. At the end of the day, building the next generation of technology means bringing the best minds of many fields into the same room, even if it\u2019s a virtual one.\n\n## Building community\n\nThe Cardano Virtual Summit 2020: Shelley Edition, won\u2019t be all work and no play. The Covid crisis has forced every conference online in past months. While we can\u2019t recreate the full physical conference experience in the virtual space, we\u2019re keen to provide some of the networking and downtime opportunities you might expect. So we\u2019ve added a virtual \u2018chill-out\u2019 zone, with guided meditations, a DJ set, and even an online calligraphy lesson/demonstration. Our virtual platform will allow attendees to enjoy the digital expo space through avatars. We\u2019ll even get the conversation flowing with a digital Shelley cocktail \u2018happy hour\u2019 between meetings.\n\nRecent events have made it difficult to meet in person but we see The Cardano Virtual Summit as an opportunity to invite everyone from around the world to participate. Attendance for anyone interested in the summit is absolutely free of charge. To join in, simply [reserve](https://www.ubivent.com/register/cardanovirtualsummit) your spot.\n\nShelley is the culmination of over 5 years of research and development, the creation of a multi-disciplinary team and a remarkable community.

Whatever the pace and cadence of future rollouts, we wanted to develop a consistent method by which all updates to the core node could be easily adopted by everyone.\n\nIn order to make that integration and interaction with Cardano easier and faster, IOHK engineers formed the Adrestia team, to take responsibility for building all the web APIs and libraries that make Cardano accessible to developers and application builders. Developments to the node can then focus on performance and scalability, while users will always be able to interact with it effortlessly.

With consistency, it can often require less time to update integrations between releases. This familiarity reduces maintenance costs. New software can then deploy in days rather than weeks. Ultimately, anyone can keep pace with change.\n\n## Get Started\n\nThe results are now live in the Byron era of Cardano. Exchanges or third-party wallets using Cardano-SL, should now be integrating to prepare for the new Byron and upgrading to Shelley wallet. These need to happen consecutively to avoid any outages. Full details have been added to the Adrestia team repo and we continue to work with our partners to ensure there is no interruption in service for ada holders keeping their funds on exchanges or in third-party wallets. The chart below shows the difference between the Cardano-SL node and the upcoming Shelley node. The components in red are non-Shelley compatible and will break after the hard fork, while the other components are Shelley compatible and will be supported during and after the hard fork.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/j_lrO83Ixg29ne93vH3dhw3qnHBGhuPcZcUG36ZCCqK9sV5V5WCPf1VoUh2XH9khEeVxFJGpZb3eBlEgw4aQX6Ejyk3tMta4ARVXrQOE9bQQcsBbWM40xPDbSvEkUrvd2vE2EFUv)\n\nConsistency is key in creating a blockchain network that works for everyone.

He recently sat down for an interview to discuss the upcoming Byron reboot, the Haskell Shelley testnet, and the conclusion of the pre-Shelley development cycle. Coutts, who has been working with IOHK since 2016, brings a wealth of knowledge from working with the Haskell programming language for nearly 20 years and helping found the Well-Typed consultancy.\n\n**What\u2019s your role at IOHK?**\n\nI\u2019m the chief technical architect for the Cardano project and I\u2019m primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the node. This means that I collaborate with the teams that work on consensus, ledger, networking, and other things. Ultimately, I work to bring everyone together around the same design after a discussion with the team leaders. The design of Cardano is the product of joint work by many individuals working together.\n\n**What does the Haskell programming language bring to Cardano?**\n\nHaskell is an enabler. It makes it easier for us to follow the approach that we believe is right, which is driven by computer science. We know how to do things properly; computer science tells us how. We just need to pick the appropriate techniques to do that. Haskell makes that easier.\n\nIt\u2019s a good fit for Cardano because it suits the high-assurance, specification-driven software that is vital for a blockchain. Haskell helps us find systematic ways of avoiding mistakes. In essence, it\u2019s a better mousetrap.\n\n**You\u2019ve been working with Haskell for a long time. How have you seen the landscape of functional programming change?**\n\nPeople take it seriously now. When I started as an undergraduate in 1999, I thought that Haskell was amazing. Other students thought, \u2018Wow that\u2019s totally impractical. How will you ever get a job?\u2019\n\nAt the time, functional programming was an academic curiosity. There wasn\u2019t any prebuilt code and it wasn\u2019t machine readable, which meant that Haskell wasn\u2019t usable for a wide range of people. There wasn\u2019t the tooling, range of libraries, or experience. That has changed over the years: the tooling got better, the libraries got better. IOHK has helped develop the infrastructure for building and distributing open-source Haskell code and the number of libraries exploded. That, combined with more teaching and a gradual change of attitude in the industry, means that people take it more seriously now. Haskell hasn\u2019t changed as much as the industry around us has.\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest change from an industry point of view?**\n\nThere are two things. The first is that attitudes are changing, albeit slowly. People are changing their opinions about what they consider a sensible language choice. Previously, everything had to be in C or Java or maybe Python, but eventually good ideas make progress, even if it takes a long time. You can make a lot of progress by just recognizing that a good idea is a good idea. The mainstream does pick up on important developments, even if it does take 10 or 15 years. The industry has not embraced functional programming wholesale yet, but individual programmers have taken up various ideas. That makes Haskell look less radical.\n\nIf you look at a language like Rust, it has some of the clever type systems of Haskell, although it doesn\u2019t have any functional programming ideas. Even Java and C++ have some functional programming ideas in them these days, so Haskell is not quite so far from the mainstream as it used to be.\n\nThe second major change has been performance, which is getting much better. We\u2019ve recently become competitive with Java in terms of performance. It makes people say, \u2018Wow, Haskell is so fast,\u2019 but that\u2019s because they\u2019re comparing it to Python and PHP rather than C. So that\u2019s another way of saying that Haskell has improved slightly, but the industry environment around it has changed as well.\n\n**You have been heavily involved in the Byron reboot which was kicked off last week. Why was this work important?**\n\nThe [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/) is the culmination of over 18 months of hard work across multiple IOHK development teams, and constitutes a complete overhaul of the node infrastructure with 100% fresh code. The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself. The Byron reboot will go a long way to improving things, and users should see Daedalus syncing and restoring wallets within minutes, even when downloading the entire Cardano blockchain.\n\n**As the chief architect, your job is to lay the foundation for Cardano\u2019s future. What have you focused on to achieve this?**\n\nThe most important aspect in terms of flexibility for the future is keeping different functions separate. One of the big improvements of the Byron reboot is that the ledger rules will be totally independent of the consensus implementation; this modularity means that the ledger rules are perfectly clean mathematical functions, which is a core aspect of functional programming.\n\nAs a result, everything is easier to test, tweak, and change, both now and in the future. The consensus algorithm isn\u2019t entangled with the details of the ledger rules, so we can alter the ledger rules without changing the consensus implementation. This makes integrating Plutus and smart contracts functionality much easier and will also help in the future when we are adding treasury and governance features.\n\nThe consensus implementation itself has also been parameterized so that we can transition from the Ouroboros Classic consensus protocol to BFT and then Praos, which also provides flexibility for future versions of the protocol that haven't been developed yet.\n\n**Shelley is a big step towards the future of Cardano, but what is the significance of compiling Haskell into JavaScript and WebAssembly?**\n\nWe\u2019re interested in compiling to JavaScript or WebAssembly because of Plutus. We want to have Plutus contracts or Plutus applications that can be distributed to users, which would include custom interfaces and custom logic with the user rather than in a server. Compiling to JavaScript allows us to do that; you can compile the Plutus code once and distribute it to users on different platforms.\n\n- - -\n\nThanks to Duncan Coutts for his time.

Plutus is no different. Compared to their object-oriented counterparts, functional programming languages are less prone to ambiguity and human error \u2013 always a good thing \u2013 as well as being easier to verify and test.

IOHK has also created a [Plutus ebook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plutus-Writing-reliable-smart-contracts-ebook/dp/B07V46LWTW \"Plutus ebook, amazon.com\") and [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/ \"Plutus Udemy course, udemy.com\") to help developers hit the ground running once Plutus is available on the Cardano mainnet.\n\n## And bringing Plutus to everyone with Marlowe\n\nThe problem with smart contracts, however, is that sometimes the people who know how to write the code don\u2019t have the industry expertise to know how to structure the contracts themselves. Enter Marlowe, IOHK\u2019s domain-specific language (DSL). Marlowe is designed for use by anyone that wants to write a financial smart contract without the programming skills to implement it. Users can try out Marlowe via the [Marlowe Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/marlowe/get-started/sample-marlowe-smart-contracts/ \"Marlowe Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"), a web utility with a user-friendly GUI and drag and drop components, where they can create financial smart contracts which, when complete, will generate fully-functional, implementation-ready Plutus code.\n\nMarlowe gives anyone the ability to gain familiarity with smart contracts while protecting them from unexpected outcomes.

The next generations of Plutus and Marlowe will be announced at the WyoHackathon at the University of Wyoming on September 20, ahead of their release on mainnet at the start of the Goguen era.

Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

Cardano and the Nervos Network. Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the [Nervos website](https://www.nervos.org/) for more information on upcoming partnerships and research initiatives.*\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/06/02/nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano/", "read_time": 3}, {"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": {"title": "Shruti Appiah", "display_name": "", "thumbnail": "https://ucarecdn.com/4df5ffe0-0a4a-4003-89e2-eb9a499b5155/", "is_team_member": true, "is_active": true, "localized": [{"job_titles": [{"name": "Product Manager", "primary": true}, {"name": "Engineering", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrutiappiah/", "twitter": "", "github": "https://github.com/ShrutiAppiah"}}], "job_titles": [{"name": "Product Manager", "primary": true}, {"name": "Engineering", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrutiappiah/", "twitter": "", "github": "https://github.com/ShrutiAppiah"}, "profile_url": "/blog/authors/shruti-appiah/", "blog_posts": [{"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/84e114f9-431a-4539-8ede-c18b883446d7/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe

Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users.

Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe (starting June 3rd), you can [register on our website](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/) for these webinars now!*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/", "read_time": 6}, {"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/84e114f9-431a-4539-8ede-c18b883446d7/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

"Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe

execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe (starting June 3rd), you can [register on our website](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/) for these webinars now!*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/", "read_time": 6}], "total_pages": 44, "current_page": 3, "filters": {"2016": {"10": 4, "12": 1, "__total": 23, "09": 5, "08": 3, "07": 5, "05": 2, "01": 3}, "2017": {"10": 7, "11": 2, "12": 5, "__total": 43, "09": 3, "08": 4, "07": 3, "06": 2, "05": 2, "04": 2, "03": 6, "02": 6, "01": 1}, "2018": {"10": 4, "12": 5, "__total": 37, "09": 1, "08": 3, "07": 3, "06": 3, "05": 4, "04": 3, "03": 3, "02": 4, "01": 4}, "2019": {"10": 1, "11": 1, "12": 1, "__total": 24, "09": 4, "07": 4, "06": 2, "05": 2, "04": 4, "03": 1, "02": 2, "01": 2}, "2020": {"10": 6, "11": 7, "12": 11, "__total": 56, "09": 3, "08": 2, "07": 4, "06": 6, "05": 5, "04": 4, "03": 3, "02": 4, "01": 1}, "2021": {"__total": 35, "06": 2, "05": 6, "04": 8, "03": 7, "02": 7, "01": 5}}, "crumbs": [{"path": "/blog/posts/page-1/", "name": "blog_posts", "active": true}]}}}

But such infrastructure for decentralized finance (DeFi) is like a road with no cars if there aren\u2019t the developers to write the contracts that will drive platform adoption and usage.\u00a0\n\nThe [Plutus pioneer program](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-our-new-plutus-pioneer-program/) was kicked off in April, as part of an evolving scheme for developer education that began over two years ago. The goal? To provide structured training for anyone who wants to learn about functional programming, so they can begin using Haskell and Plutus, and start building their first apps. Alongside this keen and committed group of  about 1,500 \u2018trainee\u2019 Plutus developers, we\u2019ve also formed partnerships with experienced software development houses to build a number of [decentralized applications](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-use-cases) (DApps) to stress-test the network, provide some early proof-of-concept applications, and assess our processes and support for the army of developers that follow.\n\nThe plan for Plutus is to have \u2018professional developers complement the work of the pioneer program and help fast-track our quality assurance and testing process towards the Alonzo hard fork,\u2019 says Silviu Petricescu, director of product strategy.\u00a0\n\n\u2018The Cardano community has been integral to us testing, improving and rolling out the network since the days of the incentivized testnet,\u2019 he adds. Professional developers add another element to the process \u2013 in terms of expertise, sitting somewhere between the core internal team and the pioneers \u2013 \u2018to scrutinize everything\u2019, he adds. \u2018Starting with documentation, tools and all the support elements that we are going to provide, they are going to be the first to test it all and give us feedback. We will include that in our internal testing and quality assurance processes.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a two-pronged approach: the pioneer scheme will be training up an army of developers, while the partner scheme will bring in heavyweight expertise to make sure everything works \u2013 that way, everyone is ready when Plutus is deployed to the mainnet as the final component of [Goguen](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/) on the Cardano roadmap. \u2018Having these developers as part of this is a way for us to ensure that our quality of build towards the next hard fork will be at the level that we want,\u2019 says Petricescu.\n\nGerard Moroney, director of operations, has been bringing these software houses into the scheme. \u2018We've been talking to companies that have experience with blockchain, and blockchain consultancies, and others that are not necessarily crypto but know distributed computing. We've also looked at consultancies that have solid Haskell experience.\u2019 Enthusiasm and passion are also part of the equation: \u2018We're working with companies that really want to try something new, something innovative and interesting. Fundamentally, we're backing people who want to be brave and be ahead of the curve.\u2019\u00a0\n\nOf course, the blockchain never sleeps and the search has taken him far and wide, holding talks with consultancy companies across Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Americas. \u2018Some of them were entirely new to us,\u2019 he says, \u2018but they already knew about Cardano and Plutus \u2013 and that's been really interesting.\u2019\n\nThese are companies that have experience in the finance sector and business so \u2018they've all got great ideas\u2019 he adds. \u2018We're giving them guidance about what we want them to work against at the beginning, but they're also coming up with new ideas \u2013 and that\u2019s a lot of fun.\u2019\u00a0\n\nMarch\u2019s [Cardano360 show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8&t=4406s) ran interviews with some of the partner companies. When it comes to software engineering, their expertise soon becomes clear. [Obsidian Systems](https://obsidian.systems/), for example, provided many of the tools and the technical support for the block validators who maintain the Tezos proof-of-stake blockchain. \n\nOn a visit to the [Metalamp](https://en.metalamp.io/) offices, you\u2019d find yourself in the city of Omsk in Siberia among a team that thrives on \u2018complex and time-consuming projects\u2019, often built on the Haskell programming language. \u2018The company had heard about Cardano and knew that \u2018it is one of the most fascinating projects written in Haskell\u2019. Some of their teams had already played with Plutus before the companies came into contact. Metalamp has experience with financial technology and has built applications involving lenders, loans, and ledgers.\u00a0\n\nOther companies supporting the rollout include:\n\n* [Eleks](https://eleks.com/): custom software engineering and consulting services since 1991. Based in Ukraine.\n* [Node Factory](https://nodefactory.io/): blockchain research and development specialist in Zagreb.\n* [MLabs](https://www.mlabs.city/): develops compilers, artificial intelligence, and DevOps applications, mostly in Haskell, Python, and Typescript.\u00a0\n* [BinarApps](https://binarapps.com/): based in Poland, this developer specializes in projects for the retail and loyalty sectors.\n\nDevelopers are looking forward to exploring applications involving digital exchanges and online sources called \u2018oracles\u2019 that bring information \u2013 whether it be commodity prices, exchange rates, airline timetables, or logistics schedules \u2013 into blockchains. The [Essential Cardano](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md) page on GitHub maps the Cardano ecosystem and links to a library of resources.\u00a0\n\n## A long time in the making\n\nOf course, Plutus will be used for complex financial smart contracts. There is a lot of money at stake with these contracts \u2013 it is reckoned that $43 billion is already locked into contracts using the Ethereum system. Yet DeFi is still at a very early stage and, as we showed in our recent [\\#CardanoAfrica](https://africa.cardano.org/) event, there is a whole new market out there for [real world use cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhIYXIMJNno&t=1012s) (or RealFi as we call it).\n\nImplementing secure smart contracts for the long term is hard, and software schedules are notoriously difficult! But the progress made by our blockchain engineers and the acceleration in the way the pieces of the Goguen jigsaw are falling into place are clear to see in the Plutus timeline below. The\u00a0[Plutus Playground](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/)\u00a0is up and running. We have about 1,500 developers building their skills within the Pioneer program, writing scripts and building prototype apps. A series of Alonzo development testnets will soon begin rolling out \u2013 with core functionality at first, followed by a process of fast iteration with new capability and new user groups added in the weeks ahead. All the while, we are advancing steadily towards deployment of Alonzo on the mainnet and the start of smart contracts on Cardano.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be an exciting summer as everyone in the Cardano community \u2013 partners, pioneers and developers of every stripe \u2013 works tirelessly to ensure that the Plutus smart contract platform hits the ground running. The secure, energy-efficient system that decentralized finance has been waiting for.\n\n*We\u2019re in the final stages of preparing the first Alonzo testnet, aiming for the end of the month. Keep an eye on our social channels this week for an update. You can try out the [Plutus Playground](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/) for yourself, and join [Plutus discussions](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/cardano-plutus/148) at the Cardano Forum. There is also a [Plutus GitHub](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus) repository. You can [register your interest](https://input-output.typeform.com/to/gQ0t9ep5) and join our [Slack

[], "body_content": "The technical infrastructure is being laid for Plutus smart contracts on Cardano. But such infrastructure for decentralized finance (DeFi) is like a road with no cars if there aren\u2019t the developers to write the contracts that will drive platform adoption and usage.\u00a0\n\nThe [Plutus pioneer program](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-our-new-plutus-pioneer-program/) was kicked off in April, as part of an evolving scheme for developer education that began over two years ago. The goal? To provide structured training for anyone who wants to learn about functional programming, so they can begin using Haskell and Plutus, and start building their first apps. Alongside this keen and committed group of  about 1,500 \u2018trainee\u2019 Plutus developers, we\u2019ve also formed partnerships with experienced software development houses to build a number of [decentralized applications](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-use-cases) (DApps) to stress-test the network, provide some early proof-of-concept applications, and assess our processes and support for the army of developers that follow.\n\nThe plan for Plutus is to have \u2018professional developers complement the work of the pioneer program and help fast-track our quality assurance and testing process towards the Alonzo hard fork,\u2019 says Silviu Petricescu, director of product strategy.\u00a0\n\n\u2018The Cardano community has been integral to us testing, improving and rolling out the network since the days of the incentivized testnet,\u2019 he adds. Professional developers add another element to the process \u2013 in terms of expertise, sitting somewhere between the core internal team and the pioneers \u2013 \u2018to scrutinize everything\u2019, he adds. \u2018Starting with documentation, tools and all the support elements that we are going to provide, they are going to be the first to test it all and give us feedback. We will include that in our internal testing and quality assurance processes.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a two-pronged approach: the pioneer scheme will be training up an army of developers, while the partner scheme will bring in heavyweight expertise to make sure everything works \u2013 that way, everyone is ready when Plutus is deployed to the mainnet as the final component of [Goguen](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/) on the Cardano roadmap. \u2018Having these developers as part of this is a way for us to ensure that our quality of build towards the next hard fork will be at the level that we want,\u2019 says Petricescu.\n\nGerard Moroney, director of operations, has been bringing these software houses into the scheme. \u2018We've been talking to companies that have experience with blockchain, and blockchain consultancies, and others that are not necessarily crypto but know distributed computing. We've also looked at consultancies that have solid Haskell experience.\u2019 Enthusiasm and passion are also part of the equation: \u2018We're working with companies that really want to try something new, something innovative and interesting. Fundamentally, we're backing people who want to be brave and be ahead of the curve.\u2019\u00a0\n\nOf course, the blockchain never sleeps and the search has taken him far and wide, holding talks with consultancy companies across Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Americas. \u2018Some of them were entirely new to us,\u2019 he says, \u2018but they already knew about Cardano and Plutus \u2013 and that's been really interesting.\u2019\n\nThese are companies that have experience in the finance sector and business so \u2018they've all got great ideas\u2019 he adds. \u2018We're giving them guidance about what we want them to work against at the beginning, but they're also coming up with new ideas \u2013 and that\u2019s a lot of fun.\u2019\u00a0\n\nMarch\u2019s [Cardano360 show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8&t=4406s) ran interviews with some of the partner companies. When it comes to software engineering, their expertise soon becomes clear. [Obsidian Systems](https://obsidian.systems/), for example, provided many of the tools and the technical support for the block validators who maintain the Tezos proof-of-stake blockchain. \n\nOn a visit to the [Metalamp](https://en.metalamp.io/) offices, you\u2019d find yourself in the city of Omsk in Siberia among a team that thrives on \u2018complex and time-consuming projects\u2019, often built on the Haskell programming language. \u2018The company had heard about Cardano and knew that \u2018it is one of the most fascinating projects written in Haskell\u2019. Some of their teams had already played with Plutus before the companies came into contact. Metalamp has experience with financial technology and has built applications involving lenders, loans, and ledgers.\u00a0\n\nOther companies supporting the rollout include:\n\n* [Eleks](https://eleks.com/): custom software engineering and consulting services since 1991. Based in Ukraine.\n* [Node Factory](https://nodefactory.io/): blockchain research and development specialist in Zagreb.\n* [MLabs](https://www.mlabs.city/): develops compilers, artificial intelligence, and DevOps applications, mostly in Haskell, Python, and Typescript.\u00a0\n* [BinarApps](https://binarapps.com/): based in Poland, this developer specializes in projects for the retail and loyalty sectors.\n\nDevelopers are looking forward to exploring applications involving digital exchanges and online sources called \u2018oracles\u2019 that bring information \u2013 whether it be commodity prices, exchange rates, airline timetables, or logistics schedules \u2013 into blockchains. The [Essential Cardano](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md) page on GitHub maps the Cardano ecosystem and links to a library of resources.\u00a0\n\n## A long time in the making\n\nOf course, Plutus will be used for complex financial smart contracts. There is a lot of money at stake with these contracts \u2013 it is reckoned that $43 billion is already locked into contracts using the Ethereum system. Yet DeFi is still at a very early stage and, as we showed in our recent [\\#CardanoAfrica](https://africa.cardano.org/) event, there is a whole new market out there for [real world use cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhIYXIMJNno&t=1012s) (or RealFi as we call it).\n\nImplementing secure smart contracts for the long term is hard, and software schedules are notoriously difficult! But the progress made by our blockchain engineers and the acceleration in the way the pieces of the Goguen jigsaw are falling into place are clear to see in the Plutus timeline below. The\u00a0[Plutus Playground](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/)\u00a0is up and running. We have about 1,500 developers building their skills within the Pioneer program, writing scripts and building prototype apps. A series of Alonzo development testnets will soon begin rolling out \u2013 with core functionality at first, followed by a process of fast iteration with new capability and new user groups added in the weeks ahead. All the while, we are advancing steadily towards deployment of Alonzo on the mainnet and the start of smart contracts on Cardano.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be an exciting summer as everyone in the Cardano community \u2013 partners, pioneers and developers of every stripe \u2013 works tirelessly to ensure that the Plutus smart contract platform hits the ground running. The secure, energy-efficient system that decentralized finance has been waiting for.\n\n*We\u2019re in the final stages of preparing the first Alonzo testnet, aiming for the end of the month. Keep an eye on our social channels this week for an update. You can try out the [Plutus Playground](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/) for yourself, and join [Plutus discussions](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/cardano-plutus/148) at the Cardano Forum.

The activation of the peer-to-peer (P2P) governor, along with the deployment of the connection manager, enabled the release of a private P2P testnet in late April.

Here, we assess how the connectivity model has matured to enable automated peer connectivity and reflect on the results of the private testnet launch.\n\n## Evolution of network connectivity\n\nWhen Cardano was launched, the Byron network connectivity model operated in a federated state. In that setting, IOHK maintained core and relay nodes that connected to about 200 other relays (Figure 1).\n\n![federated network connectivity](https://ucarecdn.com/79953bde-1cdb-48c6-9f10-c79cefffc5c6/ \"Byron federated network structure \")\n\nFigure 1. Byron federated network structure \n\nWith the launch of Shelley last year, Cardano started functioning in a hybrid setting. This allowed stake pools to construct their P2P network manually by connecting to core and relay nodes and also to the seven federated relays that helped maintain the network during this transitional phase (Figure 2).\n\n![Hybrid network connectivity](https://ucarecdn.com/1a8f1d50-73c0-4eaa-8e36-1da7021b1779/ \"Shelley\u2019s initial hybrid network structure\")\n\nFigure 2. Shelley\u2019s initial hybrid network structure\n\nSince March, block production has been entirely decentralized, with stake pools following manual topologies for P2P connections. This means that SPOs have been using a list of relay nodes registered across the globe to generate their configuration for connections with other peers. To provide better efficiency, it is essential to enable automated node communication without reliance on IO-run relay nodes. Thus, the networking team is now deploying the automated P2P code, which will allow pool operators to create and run a more decentralized network. \n\nIn this way, once the P2P mainnet is deployed, Cardano will be maintained solely by community-run nodes (Figure 3).\n\n![p2p network](https://ucarecdn.com/9b411d6f-ed34-4e67-970a-fb6cdd6abc39/ \"Final network structure with automated node communication\")\n\nFigure 3. Final network structure with automated node communication\n\n## P2P testnet and node communication\n\nThe first stage in the P2P rollout was the launch of the private P2P testnet last month. This has been used to test the basic capabilities of the components:\r\n\n+ **P2P governor**: manages hot, warm, and cold sets of peers and ensures that the node meets the target number of each type of peer. \r\n+ **Connection manager**: creates outbound connections or registers inbound connections, tracks their state, and allows full-duplex TCP connections to be reused. \r\n+ **Server**: accepts connections and performs dynamic rate limiting. \r\n+ **Inbound protocol governor**: responsible for running and tracking the state of the inbound connection side. This includes tracking the state of each remote peer (cold, warm, or hot) and the state of each inbound mini-protocol.  \n\nThe P2P system was deployed in a private environment and tested between eight nodes that connected to the mainnet and established communication with active SPO relay nodes; these further connected to other relays and block-producing nodes. The system enabled nodes to discover stake pool relays using the on-chain stake pool registry, which includes the DNS name or IP address of each relay.\n\nTest results show that the nodes could arbitrarily select peers for communication, including those from the mainnet. The use of an \u2018upstream\u2019 metric enabled the discarding of the worst-performing peers and random selection of new peers for connection. This policy has been demonstrated in large-scale simulations (10,000 nodes), providing close-to-optimal results. In the live testing, the team saw many iterations of the optimization procedure. The team also observed that a range of peer connections occurred \u2013 with both nearby and far-away peers from different locations, which was inherent to all the eight nodes run in different parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\nThe networking and DevOps teams are now working together to improve the testnet environment, so all SPOs invited to the semi-public testnet can establish direct peer connections. This includes work on feature enhancements and testing processes to deliver the most efficient results. Thus, to introduce new targets for local root peers, the team is finalizing the tests for such related features as targets for known, established, and active peers.\n\r\n\n*We will be soon launching the semi-public P2P testnet, with the support of a small group of  SPO partners to help with initial testing, before broadening this out to the wider SPO community. As ever, early feedback and ideas from our community are central to test, iterate, and improve processes as we progress towards a fully automated and decentralized P2P architecture for the Cardano mainnet.*\n\n*Additional contributions from Karl Knutsson, Duncan Coutts, Neil Davies, Prashanti Naik, and Olga Hryniuk.* ", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Cardano decentralization continues: insights into our P2P deployment", "subtitle": "Stake pools will soon be able to test automated peer-to-peer connections", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Decentralization of the Cardano network is key to ensuring its long-term sustainability, resilience, and independence from centralized governing entities.

Whether you want to understand what Cardano is and who our partners are, learn about our mission and roadmap, or get stuck in and build on Cardano, this is the place to start.\r\n\r\nInspired by GitHub's well known *Awesome* lists, the Essential Cardano list provides an outline of our thriving ecosystem, as well as a comprehensive list of resources to help you learn more and get started. As it grows and expands, this new list aims to become the canonical source of material for Cardano, including both official resources and community-generated materials. We are now looking for our community members to help us extend it even more by contributing their suggestions.\r\n\r\n## A central location of essential resources ##\r\nWe want to have a central location for all things Cardano, to bring everything together and make it easy for people to find what they need. We have provided links to all official sites, channels, and resources, as well as to a collection of material such as explainers, guides, developer resources, glossaries, primers, tutorials, and much more.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, we have identified assets developed by the community which we think provide great value and complement our own content that we produce. Our aim is that our community will now help us to grow it out and make it even better.\r\n\r\n## Navigate the Cardano ecosystem ##\r\nEssential Cardano provides an outline of all the core entities, partner groups, and facets that are part of our growing ecosystem to help orientate you to understand all the existing and new relationships that are being developed. \r\n\r\nInitially, our focus has been on curating links and references to what\u2019s going on within our growing ecosystem.

Here\u2019s how we introduced this very special event*\n\nI started Input Output in February of 2015 with a dream \u2013 to deliver economic identity to the billions of people around the world who do not have any control over their own lives.\u00a0\n\nThe reality is that people live in two different configurations; one for developed countries and one for the developing. For most people like me in the developed world, there are many things we take for granted. The fact is that it's easy for us to have an identity, passports, driving licenses. It's easy for us to travel. It's easy for us to prove our credit worthiness and get credentials. It's easy for us to borrow money, get insurance, and to process payments. For example, if someone does a service for you, you can send them something in seconds using a banking app or a mobile payment service such as Venmo. You can send them a PayPal transaction. We take this for granted and, for the most part, it's part of our daily lives.\n\nBut when you live in the developing world, things are very different. It's very difficult to globalize. It's difficult to prove claims, whether you're producing something with fair trade or in a sustainable way. It's difficult for people to receive money and send money. Remittance transactions carry a fee amounting to between 8% and 15% of the value of the transfer. When a person wants to borrow money, if it's even possible, micro-finance transactions can have interest rates as high as 85%, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe reason for these high fees is not avarice, or racism, or some evil in the global order. Rather, it's because of systems. Some countries enjoy financial infrastructure that is superior to other systems. The problem is that the legacy systems we have are fundamentally incompatible with total globalization, without admitting total centralization behind one standard, such as the American way or the Chinese way.\n\nThe world can move beyond that. This is the 21st century, a century with the iPhone, a century with the internet and the World Wide Web, a century where information can move almost instantaneously. As a consequence, we have the potential to create a better way of governing. We no longer need central entities. We no longer need central governments. Just like the internet, the things that process our payments, establish our contractual relationships, hoist up our identity, prove our property ownership, and permit the gears of commerce to work, can be done through the very same decentralized technology that has enabled innovations such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano.\n\nWe started Input Output based on first principles. We started with science. We built research labs around the world, hiring dozens of PhDs and we have since written more than a hundred papers, many of which have been tested through the wonderful crucible of academic peer review. Citation after citation later, conference after conference later, journal after journal later, we've built a corpus of scientific knowledge that has allowed us to understand how to build systems that can scale not just to millions, but to billions of users. These systems can preserve a fundamental truth, that we are all equal and we all deserve access to the same marketplaces.\n\nWhether you're a tech billionaire or a shepherd from Senegal, you should receive equal treatment and consideration. You should be given equal access to markets and merit should be the differentiator, not geography or genetics.\n\nWe have built great protocols like Cardano. It's not just about promises any more, this technology is now about delivery.\n\nFor four years, our people have lived in Ethiopia and have traveled across Africa to Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. No matter where the winds would take them, the promises and commitments and dreams were the same. We wanted to spread our vision of changing the way the world works by pushing power to the edges and allowing people to be their own bank, allowing people to have their own identity.\n\nThe first fruit of our labors is the deal with Ethiopia\u2019s Ministry of Education. This will involve five million students using [Atala Prism](https://www.atalaprism.io/) technology integrated with the Cardano blockchain. Every one of these students will have a digital identity \u2013 a DID. That DID carries with it information \u2013 metadata \u2013 that will travel with them throughout their academic life, and follow them into the economic world. When these millions of students\u00a0graduate, as they go into the economy, eventually this infrastructure can be used for buying property, for payments, for voting and all other matters of their economic life.\n\nWhat's beautiful about this deal is, is that it's extensible. Our priorities and goals are aligned with the vision, priorities and goals of the Ethiopian government. Last year, the government set out its National Digital Transformation Strategy \u2013 [Ethiopia 2025](https://mint.gov.et/diplomat-have-been-requested-to-provide-held-for-the-countrys-digital-economy-journey/?lang=en). This is a [bold vision to digitize the country](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/news/digital-roadmap-developing-world), including a national identity system. It is our belief that the work we have done here with Prism and Cardano for these five million students will inevitably grow to be an inspiration, and perhaps the system, for 107 million Ethiopians, allowing them for the first time to globalize on equal terms with the United States, the European Union, China and other powerful economies.\n\nIn addition, this system has the potential to go far beyond identity. We believe it can help people find jobs, because it can verify their credentials, helping them prove their skills. The system can be used for a litany of activities, establishing people as credible actors who have earned the right to have a job.\n\nThat's just Ethiopia. We also have partners in Tanzania, World Mobile, and partners across the continent. Every one of them has hopes and dreams about how to apply this technology. The magic of Cardano is that, like Bitcoin, it's permissionless. It does not require someone to register or license something. It does not require someone to ask to use it. Rather, it's an open platform.\n\nAnd while these projects have been spearheaded by Input Output Global and our partners, they serve as an inspiration for countless entrepreneurs in Africa. They can realize their dreams, their businesses. Whether it\u2019s a decentralized Uber, or securitizing a small company, or a new way of representing resources in trade and commerce, the result would be a piece of infrastructure accessible to all, open for everyone on the continent, to help others achieve their dreams.\n\nOur industry has created a lot of really cool innovations. NFTs, DeFi, security token offerings, and ICOs, and most of these things have been based upon promises of a new world. I believe that over the next five years, as this technology rolls out across all of Africa and many other parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe, that these promises can be transformed into new business models.\n\nThousands\u00a0of innovations are possible with blockchain infrastructure. Whether you use it to vote, to find the capital that you need as an entrepreneur to thrive, to take care of those you love, or for estate planning so that your desires and your beliefs can transcend even your own death. All of these things are possible with the technology we've constructed, built with formal methods and advanced programming languages like Haskell, and validated by peer review.\n\nGetting here has been hard, and it\u2019s only been possible with the help of thousands of people. So let\u2019s celebrate them too as we mark this first step in fulfilling the dream of giving people in Africa control over their own lives.\u00a0\n\n*For more on our work on the continent, visit our new [Cardano Africa](http://africa.cardano.org) website*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Identity is the key to our vision for Africa", "subtitle": "Decentralization and using blockchain to address real-world issues will help deliver a new future for the continent", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "*Yesterday, in the #CardanoAfrica show, we laid out our bold vision for the continent \u2013 and how we\u2019re delivering on it.

These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways. These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL.

This week we have contacted everyone interested (over 2,000) to get a better idea of their experience and expertise. Those of you who have been selected for the first round of this program will hear from us very soon.

The cohort joining this program will be true pioneers. As well as being part of a group that will have *early access* to a set of learning modules, your feedback will help us develop and iterate the overall learning experience.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe course will teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus.

We will also be holding regular Q&A sessions and you will have access to a dedicated community channel on Discord, created especially to help you to connect with other course participants as you learn. \r\n\r\nOutside the exercises and videos, students will be encouraged to learn at a pace that is right for them and to collaborate with fellow students. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week. These moderators are all graduates of the [Mongolia class of 2020](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/21/online-learning-with-haskell-the-mongolia-class-of-2020/) that completed the Haskell MOOC and are well placed to assist with questions and challenges. At the close of each week, Lars will engage directly with the group to resolve more complex technical questions and provide feedback on the subject matter covered that week. \r\n\r\n## Prior experience ##\r\nAs Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language), will be very helpful. At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts. We are also developing education programs for both [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/marlowe/marlowe-explainer.html) and [Glow](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), so don't feel like you have missed out if this Plutus course is not for you. We\u2019re still keen to have you onboard, so do watch this space for details of these other courses!\r\n\r\n## Certification ##\r\nWe will reward participants for their efforts in participating in this course and certify those pioneers that complete the entire program and are successful. These Plutus pioneer certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their knowledge and qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.\r\n \r\n## Ready to start ##\r\nWe are excited to have so many developers from our ecosystem on board and ready to get started and learn Plutus. You\u2019ll not only be learning yourselves, but acting as a pioneer to help us determine the best way to teach and deliver this course \u2013 truly helping pave the way for future cohorts who enroll!

At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts. We are also developing education programs for both [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/marlowe/marlowe-explainer.html) and [Glow](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), so don't feel like you have missed out if this Plutus course is not for you. We\u2019re still keen to have you onboard, so do watch this space for details of these other courses!\r\n\r\n## Certification ##\r\nWe will reward participants for their efforts in participating in this course and certify those pioneers that complete the entire program and are successful. These Plutus pioneer certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their knowledge and qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.\r\n \r\n## Ready to start ##\r\nWe are excited to have so many developers from our ecosystem on board and ready to get started and learn Plutus. You\u2019ll not only be learning yourselves, but acting as a pioneer to help us determine the best way to teach and deliver this course \u2013 truly helping pave the way for future cohorts who enroll! We look forward to bringing you on this learning journey before we launch Plutus to the world!

IOHK has relaunched the Mantis project to mitigate against the recent attacks, provide enhanced security, and establish a robust means of interacting with the ETC chain. A commitment to fostering innovation and sustainability lies at the heart of the project. We are aiming to provide a steady funding income with the establishment of a proto-treasury to nurture future development and growth. This Mantis re-launch represents the culmination of a project that we've been working on for some time. Over the past few months, we have resurrected our code base, and gathered a dedicated Mantis team together who have worked hard to refine and improve the code and deliver important new features.\n\n## What\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Mantis\u00a0project?\n\nMantis is a project that is built for the community, specifically designed for the developers, wallet users, and infrastructure providers to enable direct interaction with the ETC blockchain. Essentially, it is a place where future development can evolve and be tested by the community. The Mantis release includes the following components:\n- Mantis client - a CLI tool that connects to other clients in a peer-to-peer manner to allow users to communicate with the ETC chain, send and receive transactions, sync the blockchain data, execute and validate smart contracts, and deploy new smart contracts on-chain.\r\n- Mantis wallet - a node wallet with incorporated graphical user interface (GUI), which connects to both mainnet and the Sagano and Mordor testnets. \r\n- Mantis faucet - enables developers to receive testnet funds for use on the Sagano and Mordor testnets.\r\n- Mantis explorer - allows tracking recent activities and transactions in regards to the ETC chain, covering the ETC mainnet, and Sagano and Mordor testnets. \n\nPlease visit the [Mantis website](https://mantisclient.io/) where you can download the latest version of both the Mantis client and wallet.\r\n\r\nMantis software implements the official Ethereum Classic specification and Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals [(ECIPs)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) introduced by ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem. The project has undergone a number of enhancements in terms of adding robustness and variety to the client offering, including optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term. It has been developed from the ground up and built in 100% Scala code, a functional programming language that offers security guarantees that other languages do not. Mantis features include stable peer discovery, pruning, fast synchronization, and newly implemented checkpointing (for 51% attack resistance) and proto-treasury (for long-term sustainability). Let\u2019s take a closer look at these features.\n\n## Checkpointing \r\n*Persistence* and *liveness* are two crucial properties that a transaction ledger should possess. It is a proven fact that both persistence and liveness suffer when the adversarial mining power in the proof of work surpasses 50%, and in the recent year, ETC has undergone several double-spending attacks prompted by the creation of large chain reorganizations. Considering that persistence and liveness were not guaranteed within the ETC network, we sought to implement protocol changes that will re-establish persistence and liveness under current network conditions, and *checkpointing* is one of the proposed solutions. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered, by using the *k* parameter, or depth parameter, where every *k* block gets irreversibly \"checkpointed\", meaning that no one can ever drop or revert it. A trusted authority can choose the block on which to issue a checkpoint, which means that they can decide which block becomes the canonical chain that all parties should follow. This trusted authority must run continuously and is responsible for publishing the checkpoint to the network. Checkpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered with regards to mining. The mining rewards are not affected and the checkpointing federation can only issue checkpoints on blocks that have valid proof of work and cannot mint blocks on its own. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing is now implemented within the Mantis project, and according to our recent [ECIP comparison for 51% attack resistance](https://static.iohk.io/docs/etc/ecip-comparison-for-51-attack-resistance.pdf), it provides far greater, and importantly formally proven, security against these types of attacks. It is important that any 51% attack mitigation is truly robust enough to give absolute certainty to ETC holders, users, and service providers that their transactions will be secure.\r\n\n## Proto-Treasury\r\nFor the longer-term health and success of the ETC ecosystem, we position network growth, sustainability, and innovation as key elements to ensure network security. With that in mind, we are implementing a proto-treasury system within the Mantis project to establish a steady funding income.  A well-developed governance strategy will enable effective, distributed funding for the long-term development of Mantis, whereas a decentralized treasury would ensure two important things for the future of the ecosystem:\r\n- Firstly, it would provide a permanent ongoing source of funding for the ETC network. while increasing the value of the ecosystem and promoting greater developer engagement. \r\n\r\n- Secondly, it would provide a distributed and transparent funding mechanism, which lets the ETC community determine its future growth and enable the sustainability required for innovation and growth.\r\n\r\nEstablishing the treasury for funding purposes ensures a clear vision of the substantial system maintenance focused to obtain innovation and diversity from other projects, including proof of stake (PoS) and newer blockchains. This solution is straightforward in its optimization for speed and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal foresees to distribute 80% of existing mining rewards to miners and 20% to the proto-treasury smart contract. The treasury will be controlled by the community and will enable a decentralized, collaborative decision-making process, offering an opt-in type collaboration for those who are interested.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\r\nAs much as we\u2019re excited about the Mantis relaunch, it should be stressed that its capability won\u2019t be limited to just the features outlined here. Mantis is an evolving project and right now we are establishing its foundational building blocks and running rigorous security audits. Further down the road, it will see more performance improvements in terms of CPU, GPU and ASICs compatibility, a new proof-of-work consensus protocol and algorithm introduction (PRISM consensus, Keccak256 algorithm) and, of course, additional enhancements for better interoperability and speed of transaction processing.

A key focus in IOHK for 2020 is to develop and expand our education materials as we transition fully into the Shelley era and then to the Goguen era of Cardano.\n\nThe IOHK education team will be investing significant time and effort this year in broadening our range of materials. We aim to enhance understanding of our technologies using a variety of learning and training assets targeted at a wide range of stakeholder audiences, both internal and external. This will be vital as the use of IOHK technology moves into the mainstream. We also aim to provide knowledge and information to enterprise decision-makers so they know what business problems our technologies can solve. We have lots planned and many projects are underway as we grow Cardano into a global social and financial operating system.\n\n## What can you expect?\n\nWe started 2020 with lectures, by Dr Lars Br\u00fcnjes, our director of education, at the University of Malta. The focus of these lectures was on Plutus and Marlowe, our programming languages for smart contracts. The fruits of these sessions will, in turn, form the foundation of some modular training materials that we plan to formalize and develop over the coming months.\n\nOur free Udemy courses on [Plutus](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/) and [Marlowe](https://www.udemy.com/course/marlowe-programming-language/) by Alejandro Garcia have proven very popular, with over 5,000 students signed up. Feedback has been positive and, as a result of what we learned from our students, we\u2019ve been making incremental improvements over the last year. We now want to take this to the next level and are planning to fully update both courses soon to bring them up to speed with the latest development changes and new features. We are also in the initial planning stages for a second edition of the ebook, [Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts](https://leanpub.com/plutus-smart-contracts) by Lars Br\u00fcnjes and Polina Vinogradova, which we will be publishing later this year. The writing team has started to identify improvements and we are also gathering feedback directly from readers. If you have suggestions, please raise a pull request in our [Plutus ebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-book) with your ideas.\n\nAn important step in bridging the gap between our academic papers and mainstream understanding of these concepts is to teach people about Ouroboros, the proof-of-stake protocol that powers Cardano and ada. In response to the valuable feedback we have received from running the Incentivized Testnet, we are planning to create varied educational content to help stake pool operators understand Ouroboros and how the protocol works on a practical level.\n\n## Broadening our reach\n\nTo broaden the reach of our training courses and content, we are also investigating a way to migrate our popular Haskell training course into a massive online course, or MOOC, while also making it more comprehensive with the inclusion of Plutus and Marlowe material. In this way, we hope our MOOC will make the course even more valuable, and provide access to the widest possible global community. In addition, we are planning a comprehensive classroom-based Haskell and Plutus course in Mongolia, details of which will be finalized soon. We plan to use the introductory part of the online Haskell course as a primer for this face-to-face training. This is an example of a core efficiency that we are embracing where we aim to reuse content on Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe across a variety of stand-alone modular materials that we can use externally and within the company for developing our staff.\n\nWe appreciate the value of interactive and meaningful training workshops, so we intend to host many more this year in several locations around the world. These events are in the initial planning stages and the first in the series will take place in Quebec in the spring. We\u2019ll announce more details through our official channels \u2013 Twitter, email, here \u2013 nearer the time. The IOHK education team are on hand to support and prepare the necessary learning tools for participants to use at these events.\n\nAlongside these materials and courses, we are mentoring an undergraduate student at the International University of Management (ISM), with her thesis on the topic of the power of blockchain in emerging markets. Additionally, Dr Jamie Gabbay has been invited to contribute to the book '*Applications of new generation technology to cryptocurrencies, banking, and finance*\u2019 by Devraj Basu.\n\n## Internal initiatives\n\nWe are also working with our human resources team to build the IOHK Training Academy: a new learning portal for our internal teams to upskill and develop professionally. This new resource is part of our learning and development strategy that aims to improve employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We want to provide access to a library of assets so our staff can easily find exactly what they need. We will be developing tailored \u2018learning journeys\u2019 by function, ready-made content that will help people develop skills in new areas, as well as creating specific onboarding journeys for new starters. This is a vital resource for a fast-growing company with staff and contractors spread across 43 countries and will prove to be an important asset for all our people.\n\n2020 is going to be a pivotal year for Cardano and we are looking forward to playing our part. It is our aim to teach both individuals and organizations how to use the protocol, and how it can help with their everyday lives.

These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2.

Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways.

This new innovative program aims to recruit and train developers within the ecosystem so that they are fully prepared when Plutus is deployed to the Cardano mainnet later this year.\n\n\r\n\r\nSince we announced this new course on [March\u2019s Cardano360 show](https://youtu.be/ULBLgPgxtN8?t=3731) we have had a huge expression of interest from our developer community, both from developers who want to create decentralized applications (DApps), and smart contract programmers who want to work with Cardano\u2019s principal development language. This week we have contacted everyone interested (over 2,000) to get a better idea of their experience and expertise. Those of you who have been selected for the first round of this program will hear from us very soon. If you don\u2019t receive an invitation at this stage, don\u2019t worry as we will be running several rounds of this program, so please do stay in touch!\n\n\r\n\r\n## Course structure ##\r\nThe first iteration of the new program starts next week.  The cohort joining this program will be true pioneers. As well as being part of a group that will have *early access* to a set of learning modules, your feedback will help us develop and iterate the overall learning experience.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe course will teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus. The course modules will cover the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including functions and data types, type classes, monads, template Haskell, using the [Plutus Playground](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/01/25/introducing-the-new-plutus-playground/), the [Extended UTXO model](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/), working with Plutus on and off the chain, minting policies, state machines, the Plutus application framework, as well as some case studies and practical exercises. \n\r\n\r\nThe course will follow a modular approach and will be highly interactive \u2013 each week we will be releasing new teaching videos from our director of education, Lars Br\u00fcnjes, along with a set of practical exercises to complete during the week as part of each module. We will also be holding regular Q&A sessions and you will have access to a dedicated community channel on Discord, created especially to help you to connect with other course participants as you learn. \r\n\r\nOutside the exercises and videos, students will be encouraged to learn at a pace that is right for them and to collaborate with fellow students. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week. These moderators are all graduates of the [Mongolia class of 2020](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/21/online-learning-with-haskell-the-mongolia-class-of-2020/) that completed the Haskell MOOC and are well placed to assist with questions and challenges. At the close of each week, Lars will engage directly with the group to resolve more complex technical questions and provide feedback on the subject matter covered that week. \r\n\r\n## Prior experience ##\r\nAs Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language), will be very helpful. At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts. We are also developing education programs for both [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/marlowe/marlowe-explainer.html) and [Glow](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), so don't feel like you have missed out if this Plutus course is not for you.

These Plutus pioneer certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their knowledge and qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.\r\n \r\n## Ready to start ##\r\nWe are excited to have so many developers from our ecosystem on board and ready to get started and learn Plutus. You\u2019ll not only be learning yourselves, but acting as a pioneer to help us determine the best way to teach and deliver this course \u2013 truly helping pave the way for future cohorts who enroll! We look forward to bringing you on this learning journey before we launch Plutus to the world!

This new innovative program aims to recruit and train developers within the ecosystem so that they are fully prepared when Plutus is deployed to the Cardano mainnet later this year.\n\n\r\n\r\nSince we announced this new course on [March\u2019s Cardano360 show](https://youtu.be/ULBLgPgxtN8?t=3731) we have had a huge expression of interest from our developer community, both from developers who want to create decentralized applications (DApps), and smart contract programmers who want to work with Cardano\u2019s principal development language. This week we have contacted everyone interested (over 2,000) to get a better idea of their experience and expertise. Those of you who have been selected for the first round of this program will hear from us very soon. If you don\u2019t receive an invitation at this stage, don\u2019t worry as we will be running several rounds of this program, so please do stay in touch!\n\n\r\n\r\n## Course structure ##\r\nThe first iteration of the new program starts next week.  The cohort joining this program will be true pioneers. As well as being part of a group that will have *early access* to a set of learning modules, your feedback will help us develop and iterate the overall learning experience.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe course will teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus. The course modules will cover the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including functions and data types, type classes, monads, template Haskell, using the [Plutus Playground](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/01/25/introducing-the-new-plutus-playground/), the [Extended UTXO model](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/), working with Plutus on and off the chain, minting policies, state machines, the Plutus application framework, as well as some case studies and practical exercises. \n\r\n\r\nThe course will follow a modular approach and will be highly interactive \u2013 each week we will be releasing new teaching videos from our director of education, Lars Br\u00fcnjes, along with a set of practical exercises to complete during the week as part of each module. We will also be holding regular Q&A sessions and you will have access to a dedicated community channel on Discord, created especially to help you to connect with other course participants as you learn. \r\n\r\nOutside the exercises and videos, students will be encouraged to learn at a pace that is right for them and to collaborate with fellow students. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week. These moderators are all graduates of the [Mongolia class of 2020](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/21/online-learning-with-haskell-the-mongolia-class-of-2020/) that completed the Haskell MOOC and are well placed to assist with questions and challenges. At the close of each week, Lars will engage directly with the group to resolve more complex technical questions and provide feedback on the subject matter covered that week. \r\n\r\n## Prior experience ##\r\nAs Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language), will be very helpful. At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts.

IOHK has relaunched the Mantis project to mitigate against the recent attacks, provide enhanced security, and establish a robust means of interacting with the ETC chain. A commitment to fostering innovation and sustainability lies at the heart of the project. We are aiming to provide a steady funding income with the establishment of a proto-treasury to nurture future development and growth. This Mantis re-launch represents the culmination of a project that we've been working on for some time. Over the past few months, we have resurrected our code base, and gathered a dedicated Mantis team together who have worked hard to refine and improve the code and deliver important new features.\n\n## What\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Mantis\u00a0project?\n\nMantis is a project that is built for the community, specifically designed for the developers, wallet users, and infrastructure providers to enable direct interaction with the ETC blockchain. Essentially, it is a place where future development can evolve and be tested by the community. The Mantis release includes the following components:\n- Mantis client - a CLI tool that connects to other clients in a peer-to-peer manner to allow users to communicate with the ETC chain, send and receive transactions, sync the blockchain data, execute and validate smart contracts, and deploy new smart contracts on-chain.\r\n- Mantis wallet - a node wallet with incorporated graphical user interface (GUI), which connects to both mainnet and the Sagano and Mordor testnets. \r\n- Mantis faucet - enables developers to receive testnet funds for use on the Sagano and Mordor testnets.\r\n- Mantis explorer - allows tracking recent activities and transactions in regards to the ETC chain, covering the ETC mainnet, and Sagano and Mordor testnets. \n\nPlease visit the [Mantis website](https://mantisclient.io/) where you can download the latest version of both the Mantis client and wallet.\r\n\r\nMantis software implements the official Ethereum Classic specification and Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals [(ECIPs)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) introduced by ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem. The project has undergone a number of enhancements in terms of adding robustness and variety to the client offering, including optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term. It has been developed from the ground up and built in 100% Scala code, a functional programming language that offers security guarantees that other languages do not. Mantis features include stable peer discovery, pruning, fast synchronization, and newly implemented checkpointing (for 51% attack resistance) and proto-treasury (for long-term sustainability). Let\u2019s take a closer look at these features.\n\n## Checkpointing \r\n*Persistence* and *liveness* are two crucial properties that a transaction ledger should possess. It is a proven fact that both persistence and liveness suffer when the adversarial mining power in the proof of work surpasses 50%, and in the recent year, ETC has undergone several double-spending attacks prompted by the creation of large chain reorganizations. Considering that persistence and liveness were not guaranteed within the ETC network, we sought to implement protocol changes that will re-establish persistence and liveness under current network conditions, and *checkpointing* is one of the proposed solutions. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered, by using the *k* parameter, or depth parameter, where every *k* block gets irreversibly \"checkpointed\", meaning that no one can ever drop or revert it. A trusted authority can choose the block on which to issue a checkpoint, which means that they can decide which block becomes the canonical chain that all parties should follow. This trusted authority must run continuously and is responsible for publishing the checkpoint to the network. Checkpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered with regards to mining. The mining rewards are not affected and the checkpointing federation can only issue checkpoints on blocks that have valid proof of work and cannot mint blocks on its own. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing is now implemented within the Mantis project, and according to our recent [ECIP comparison for 51% attack resistance](https://static.iohk.io/docs/etc/ecip-comparison-for-51-attack-resistance.pdf), it provides far greater, and importantly formally proven, security against these types of attacks. It is important that any 51% attack mitigation is truly robust enough to give absolute certainty to ETC holders, users, and service providers that their transactions will be secure.\r\n\n## Proto-Treasury\r\nFor the longer-term health and success of the ETC ecosystem, we position network growth, sustainability, and innovation as key elements to ensure network security. With that in mind, we are implementing a proto-treasury system within the Mantis project to establish a steady funding income.  A well-developed governance strategy will enable effective, distributed funding for the long-term development of Mantis, whereas a decentralized treasury would ensure two important things for the future of the ecosystem:\r\n- Firstly, it would provide a permanent ongoing source of funding for the ETC network. while increasing the value of the ecosystem and promoting greater developer engagement. \r\n\r\n- Secondly, it would provide a distributed and transparent funding mechanism, which lets the ETC community determine its future growth and enable the sustainability required for innovation and growth.\r\n\r\nEstablishing the treasury for funding purposes ensures a clear vision of the substantial system maintenance focused to obtain innovation and diversity from other projects, including proof of stake (PoS) and newer blockchains. This solution is straightforward in its optimization for speed and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal foresees to distribute 80% of existing mining rewards to miners and 20% to the proto-treasury smart contract. The treasury will be controlled by the community and will enable a decentralized, collaborative decision-making process, offering an opt-in type collaboration for those who are interested.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\r\nAs much as we\u2019re excited about the Mantis relaunch, it should be stressed that its capability won\u2019t be limited to just the features outlined here. Mantis is an evolving project and right now we are establishing its foundational building blocks and running rigorous security audits. Further down the road, it will see more performance improvements in terms of CPU, GPU and ASICs compatibility, a new proof-of-work consensus protocol and algorithm introduction (PRISM consensus, Keccak256 algorithm) and, of course, additional enhancements for better interoperability and speed of transaction processing.

Our mission is to grow our global community and business through the medium of education, and to share what we have learned. By claiming leadership in worldwide education on blockchain technology, we have the chance to shape the field for generations and to leave a lasting legacy.\n\nA consistent theme from 2019 has been the demand for a broad range of educational content, as demonstrated by the feedback received about the Incentivized Testnet, as well as the steady flow of support requests to our helpdesk. A key focus in IOHK for 2020 is to develop and expand our education materials as we transition fully into the Shelley era and then to the Goguen era of Cardano.\n\nThe IOHK education team will be investing significant time and effort this year in broadening our range of materials. We aim to enhance understanding of our technologies using a variety of learning and training assets targeted at a wide range of stakeholder audiences, both internal and external. This will be vital as the use of IOHK technology moves into the mainstream. We also aim to provide knowledge and information to enterprise decision-makers so they know what business problems our technologies can solve. We have lots planned and many projects are underway as we grow Cardano into a global social and financial operating system.\n\n## What can you expect?\n\nWe started 2020 with lectures, by Dr Lars Br\u00fcnjes, our director of education, at the University of Malta. The focus of these lectures was on Plutus and Marlowe, our programming languages for smart contracts. The fruits of these sessions will, in turn, form the foundation of some modular training materials that we plan to formalize and develop over the coming months.\n\nOur free Udemy courses on [Plutus](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/) and [Marlowe](https://www.udemy.com/course/marlowe-programming-language/) by Alejandro Garcia have proven very popular, with over 5,000 students signed up. Feedback has been positive and, as a result of what we learned from our students, we\u2019ve been making incremental improvements over the last year. We now want to take this to the next level and are planning to fully update both courses soon to bring them up to speed with the latest development changes and new features. We are also in the initial planning stages for a second edition of the ebook, [Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts](https://leanpub.com/plutus-smart-contracts) by Lars Br\u00fcnjes and Polina Vinogradova, which we will be publishing later this year. The writing team has started to identify improvements and we are also gathering feedback directly from readers. If you have suggestions, please raise a pull request in our [Plutus ebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-book) with your ideas.\n\nAn important step in bridging the gap between our academic papers and mainstream understanding of these concepts is to teach people about Ouroboros, the proof-of-stake protocol that powers Cardano and ada. In response to the valuable feedback we have received from running the Incentivized Testnet, we are planning to create varied educational content to help stake pool operators understand Ouroboros and how the protocol works on a practical level.\n\n## Broadening our reach\n\nTo broaden the reach of our training courses and content, we are also investigating a way to migrate our popular Haskell training course into a massive online course, or MOOC, while also making it more comprehensive with the inclusion of Plutus and Marlowe material. In this way, we hope our MOOC will make the course even more valuable, and provide access to the widest possible global community. In addition, we are planning a comprehensive classroom-based Haskell and Plutus course in Mongolia, details of which will be finalized soon. We plan to use the introductory part of the online Haskell course as a primer for this face-to-face training. This is an example of a core efficiency that we are embracing where we aim to reuse content on Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe across a variety of stand-alone modular materials that we can use externally and within the company for developing our staff.\n\nWe appreciate the value of interactive and meaningful training workshops, so we intend to host many more this year in several locations around the world. These events are in the initial planning stages and the first in the series will take place in Quebec in the spring. We\u2019ll announce more details through our official channels \u2013 Twitter, email, here \u2013 nearer the time. The IOHK education team are on hand to support and prepare the necessary learning tools for participants to use at these events.\n\nAlongside these materials and courses, we are mentoring an undergraduate student at the International University of Management (ISM), with her thesis on the topic of the power of blockchain in emerging markets. Additionally, Dr Jamie Gabbay has been invited to contribute to the book '*Applications of new generation technology to cryptocurrencies, banking, and finance*\u2019 by Devraj Basu.\n\n## Internal initiatives\n\nWe are also working with our human resources team to build the IOHK Training Academy: a new learning portal for our internal teams to upskill and develop professionally. This new resource is part of our learning and development strategy that aims to improve employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We want to provide access to a library of assets so our staff can easily find exactly what they need. We will be developing tailored \u2018learning journeys\u2019 by function, ready-made content that will help people develop skills in new areas, as well as creating specific onboarding journeys for new starters. This is a vital resource for a fast-growing company with staff and contractors spread across 43 countries and will prove to be an important asset for all our people.\n\n2020 is going to be a pivotal year for Cardano and we are looking forward to playing our part. It is our aim to teach both individuals and organizations how to use the protocol, and how it can help with their everyday lives. We have lots to do and we look forward to sharing all the educational content that we produce with our existing community, as well as those of you who are new to Cardano.

The fruits of these sessions will, in turn, form the foundation of some modular training materials that we plan to formalize and develop over the coming months.\n\nOur free Udemy courses on [Plutus](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/) and [Marlowe](https://www.udemy.com/course/marlowe-programming-language/) by Alejandro Garcia have proven very popular, with over 5,000 students signed up. Feedback has been positive and, as a result of what we learned from our students, we\u2019ve been making incremental improvements over the last year. We now want to take this to the next level and are planning to fully update both courses soon to bring them up to speed with the latest development changes and new features. We are also in the initial planning stages for a second edition of the ebook, [Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts](https://leanpub.com/plutus-smart-contracts) by Lars Br\u00fcnjes and Polina Vinogradova, which we will be publishing later this year. The writing team has started to identify improvements and we are also gathering feedback directly from readers. If you have suggestions, please raise a pull request in our [Plutus ebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-book) with your ideas.\n\nAn important step in bridging the gap between our academic papers and mainstream understanding of these concepts is to teach people about Ouroboros, the proof-of-stake protocol that powers Cardano and ada. In response to the valuable feedback we have received from running the Incentivized Testnet, we are planning to create varied educational content to help stake pool operators understand Ouroboros and how the protocol works on a practical level.\n\n## Broadening our reach\n\nTo broaden the reach of our training courses and content, we are also investigating a way to migrate our popular Haskell training course into a massive online course, or MOOC, while also making it more comprehensive with the inclusion of Plutus and Marlowe material. In this way, we hope our MOOC will make the course even more valuable, and provide access to the widest possible global community. In addition, we are planning a comprehensive classroom-based Haskell and Plutus course in Mongolia, details of which will be finalized soon. We plan to use the introductory part of the online Haskell course as a primer for this face-to-face training. This is an example of a core efficiency that we are embracing where we aim to reuse content on Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe across a variety of stand-alone modular materials that we can use externally and within the company for developing our staff.\n\nWe appreciate the value of interactive and meaningful training workshops, so we intend to host many more this year in several locations around the world. These events are in the initial planning stages and the first in the series will take place in Quebec in the spring. We\u2019ll announce more details through our official channels \u2013 Twitter, email, here \u2013 nearer the time. The IOHK education team are on hand to support and prepare the necessary learning tools for participants to use at these events.\n\nAlongside these materials and courses, we are mentoring an undergraduate student at the International University of Management (ISM), with her thesis on the topic of the power of blockchain in emerging markets. Additionally, Dr Jamie Gabbay has been invited to contribute to the book '*Applications of new generation technology to cryptocurrencies, banking, and finance*\u2019 by Devraj Basu.\n\n## Internal initiatives\n\nWe are also working with our human resources team to build the IOHK Training Academy: a new learning portal for our internal teams to upskill and develop professionally. This new resource is part of our learning and development strategy that aims to improve employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We want to provide access to a library of assets so our staff can easily find exactly what they need. We will be developing tailored \u2018learning journeys\u2019 by function, ready-made content that will help people develop skills in new areas, as well as creating specific onboarding journeys for new starters. This is a vital resource for a fast-growing company with staff and contractors spread across 43 countries and will prove to be an important asset for all our people.\n\n2020 is going to be a pivotal year for Cardano and we are looking forward to playing our part. It is our aim to teach both individuals and organizations how to use the protocol, and how it can help with their everyday lives. We have lots to do and we look forward to sharing all the educational content that we produce with our existing community, as well as those of you who are new to Cardano.

These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways.

Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

Cardano and the Nervos Network. Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the [Nervos website](https://www.nervos.org/) for more information on upcoming partnerships and research initiatives.*\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/06/02/nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano/", "read_time": 3}, {"publish_date": "2021-02-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/b32a85c3-d8e4-4756-8972-df0fe7be0062/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Bringing Glow to Cardano", "subtitle": " We just spun up a devnet to support Glow, the very latest language Cardano will support.

We caught up with Rideau (also known as Fare) to hear more about his vision for Glow and the Cardano journey so far. The following is a distillation of his thoughts from our previous interviews.*\n\n\n\n**We first introduced the community to GLOW and MuKn at the end of [last year](https://youtu.be/lj9SlvOIBgU?t=2902) when we announced our devnets approach \u2013\u00a0 but maybe you can remind us how you began working with IOHK?**\n\nI started as a researcher in formal methods for programming languages and distributed systems. But I wanted to build systems actually used by many, so I moved into the industry where I notably worked on proving the correctness of a centralized payment protocol and creating an airline reservation system. After a few years at Google and Bridgewater, I decided life wasn\u2019t worth working under dysfunctional hierarchies, so I started my own cryptocurrency companies. Charles invited me to speak at the IOHK Summit 2019, and I realized how much I like the Cardano community: we have a similar focus on building robust software for the long term. That is why I wanted to port my domain specific language Glow to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Tell us a bit why you started your company Mutual Knowledge Systems, or as you call it MuKn (Moon)?**\n\nOver three years ago, I was reviewing whitepapers. Most papers (about \u00be) had interesting techniques but made no economic sense. Most of the rest (about \u2155) made economic sense but had no technical content. Only the top few (about 5%) actually made sense both technically and economically. At some point, I realized I could do better, so I designed a scaling solution using lessons learned from working on Tezos. Arthur Breitman challenged me to use smart contracts instead of trying to modify his protocol. \n\nWhile trying to prove his challenge absurd, I instead found that he was right and I was wrong\u2014and I finally understood why and how to use smart contracts. I started a company around the resulting scaling solution, raised money, pivoted into building the scaling solution after the language capable of generating it from specification, fought with and fired my then-partner, became my own CEO, started a new company, and, after much struggle, finally found the right founding team. Together, we built Mutual Knowledge Systems around this new programming language, Glow\u2014designed to be much better than existing languages to write decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n**When you say \u2018better\u2019, what do you really mean?**\n\nWriting a DApp is the single hardest thing to do in the world. This is because you can\u2019t afford a mistake, or your users may lose significant funds. Furthermore, you are not confronting random situations, but active adversaries bent on attacking your code, who will contrive the very worst case scenarios to exploit for their profit. Yet, unlike the military, you can\u2019t hide your code or protect access to your networks: all the critical pieces are necessarily public. On top of that, extant programming tools are not designed for these constraints and even traditional formal methods lack essential concepts to express the issues at stake.\n\nThus, we decided to make new tools fit for the challenge. Our domain-specific language (DSL) drastically simplifies DApp development, by abstracting away all the common blockchain infrastructure, so you can focus on your problem domain (trading, derivatives, insurance, supply chain, etc.). Your DApps can be thousands of lines of code that your users can afford to audit, instead of millions of lines of code that require leaps of blind faith. And the programming model will enable developers, auditors and automated verification tools to reason at the level of abstraction of participants exchanging assets, rather than at that of packets of bytes shipped around the Internet.\n\n\n\n**What is it about Cardano and its community that appeals?**\n\nI started like everyone else, on Ethereum, because its ecosystem is already mature. However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s got great fundamentals.\n\n\n\n**Can you talk about how you hope Glow will change the DApp developer experience?**\n\nGlow is portable. Today it works on Cardano and Ethereum but in the future it will work with any blockchain that is sufficiently advanced to support smart contracts. That means that you can write your DApp once and it will run on whichever platform has the users and the liquidity you seek. You don\u2019t have to make a guess about where liquidity will be in the future then sink heavy investments to develop on a single chain that you bet your house on.\n\n\n\nWith Glow, developers can run their DApps on all blockchains. Glow will commoditize blockchains. Blockchains will then compete on technical and economic merits, not on user lock-in and inertia. And the value brought to users will increase.\n\n\n\n**What can the community expect from Glow?**\n\nWe have launched this early version of Glow on the Cardano EVM Devnet with a command-line interface. In many ways, it is not yet ready for use by end-users, but it can already demonstrate simple applications. Users can also see how they may write a 6 line application in Glow that would require hundreds of lines in a combination of Solidity and JavaScript. We have a roadmap over the next few months to add a lot of features: from ERC20 tokens (and, on Cardano, native tokens), to generalized state channels, to a web interface, to a more robust runtime, etc. Eventually, we want to become the development environment for all blockchain projects. And Glow is of course an open source software open to the community.\n\n**We\u2019re rolling out the integration with Glow with our EVM and devnet program, so what are some of the benefits of this?**\n\nThe Cardano EVM side-chain will enable arbitrary contracts to run on Cardano that use the mature EVM platform, without waiting for Plutus to deliver its promise, to achieve feature-parity, to be considered stable, etc. And Glow can run on this EVM side-chain and provide the simplicity, safety and portability in DApp development that were not available before.\n\n**What is the rollout process like and how can our community get involved if they want to?**\n\nGlow is still in development. There are some things that it can do already and some it can\u2019t do yet. We invite DApp developers to join the Glow community and use the language for what it can already do, and otherwise help us build the blockchain development environment of the future. You can build the missing features you need yourself, or contract MuKn to build them for you. Even if you can\u2019t code and have no budget, you can help write the documentation, or even just tell us where it isn\u2019t clear yet, or what features you need most so we know what to prioritize. Together, we can build great DApps that you just couldn\u2019t have achieved safely and within budget with previous tools.\n\n*If you\u2019re a developer, we encourage you to get involved with [Mutual Knowledge Systems and Glow](https://mukn.io/).

However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s got great fundamentals.\n\n\n\n**Can you talk about how you hope Glow will change the DApp developer experience?**\n\nGlow is portable. Today it works on Cardano and Ethereum but in the future it will work with any blockchain that is sufficiently advanced to support smart contracts. That means that you can write your DApp once and it will run on whichever platform has the users and the liquidity you seek. You don\u2019t have to make a guess about where liquidity will be in the future then sink heavy investments to develop on a single chain that you bet your house on.\n\n\n\nWith Glow, developers can run their DApps on all blockchains. Glow will commoditize blockchains. Blockchains will then compete on technical and economic merits, not on user lock-in and inertia. And the value brought to users will increase.\n\n\n\n**What can the community expect from Glow?**\n\nWe have launched this early version of Glow on the Cardano EVM Devnet with a command-line interface. In many ways, it is not yet ready for use by end-users, but it can already demonstrate simple applications. Users can also see how they may write a 6 line application in Glow that would require hundreds of lines in a combination of Solidity and JavaScript. We have a roadmap over the next few months to add a lot of features: from ERC20 tokens (and, on Cardano, native tokens), to generalized state channels, to a web interface, to a more robust runtime, etc. Eventually, we want to become the development environment for all blockchain projects. And Glow is of course an open source software open to the community.\n\n**We\u2019re rolling out the integration with Glow with our EVM and devnet program, so what are some of the benefits of this?**\n\nThe Cardano EVM side-chain will enable arbitrary contracts to run on Cardano that use the mature EVM platform, without waiting for Plutus to deliver its promise, to achieve feature-parity, to be considered stable, etc. And Glow can run on this EVM side-chain and provide the simplicity, safety and portability in DApp development that were not available before.\n\n**What is the rollout process like and how can our community get involved if they want to?**\n\nGlow is still in development. There are some things that it can do already and some it can\u2019t do yet. We invite DApp developers to join the Glow community and use the language for what it can already do, and otherwise help us build the blockchain development environment of the future. You can build the missing features you need yourself, or contract MuKn to build them for you. Even if you can\u2019t code and have no budget, you can help write the documentation, or even just tell us where it isn\u2019t clear yet, or what features you need most so we know what to prioritize. Together, we can build great DApps that you just couldn\u2019t have achieved safely and within budget with previous tools.\n\n*If you\u2019re a developer, we encourage you to get involved with [Mutual Knowledge Systems and Glow](https://mukn.io/).

In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Decentralizing social media: a conversation with Ben Goertzel and Charles Hoskinson", "subtitle": "The minds behind SingularityNET and Cardano come together to explore a vision of the future of decentralization, AI, and social media.", "audio": null, "soundcloud": null, "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\n*At the end of 2020, we announced our collaboration with SingularityNET, in an exclusive [fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3O5F_CCT8c) between Charles Hoskinson and SingularityNET founder & CEO, Ben Goertzel.*\u00a0\n\n*SingularityNET recently shared further information on the partnership when they announced their exciting [Phase Two initiative](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a),* [](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a) *which includes a shift from Ethereum to Cardano, to achieve new network functionalities and launching a Stream of New AGI-ADA Tokens.*\n\n*Last week, Charles and Ben sat down again together in a special [SingularityNET podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNWJGGc7ESI). In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms.

To encourage participation, IOHK is sponsoring a prize fund of ada worth $10,000 as well as ongoing support to bring the projects to fruition. Proposals will be judged by a panel of IOHK and UN employees. They will determine the winners based on an idea\u2019s technical prowess, scalability and social impact, as well as its financial and volunteer support. The winning ideas will be able to seek the advice of experts from both the UN and IOHK to ensure that they are implemented in the most impactful way.\n\nTo qualify for the scheme, entries must be open source and be created for use on the Cardano blockchain. Example code should be written in Marlowe, a domain specific language developed for financial contracts on Cardano. These do not need to be fully coded submissions. Instead they can be ideas which inspire anyone to get involved with blockchain technology and sustainable development. The proposal submission period opens on Saturday October 10th.

Every presentation, panel and guest speaker at this online event, has been chosen to represent the many faces of Cardano. From world-class foundational research to the latest advances in cryptographic development; from the passion and dedication of the wider community to some of the innovators who have created our world and are lighting the path to the future. The event is meant to honor the hard work and dedication of the Cardano community, developers and contributors, and the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe virtual summit, much like IOHK\u2019s 2019 Miami summit will include presentations from IOHK team members, special guest appearances by thought leaders and a keynote speech by IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson. We were proud to announce that our guest of honor is internet co-creator and lead internet evangelist for Google, Vint Cerf. As one of the lead architects of the internet Vint is uniquely positioned to give us insight into building world changing technology.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be joined by Caitlin Long of the Wyoming Blockchain Select Committee. The Wall Street professional turned crypto pioneer has been blazing the trail for adoption in the state of Wyoming. She will give us a look at the challenges and opportunities she has faced while pushing for wider adoption of decentralization. Our final special guest, Stephen Wolfram is the creator of the computational knowledge platform Wolfram Alpha and the CEO of Wolfram Research. Cardano shares his dedication to advancing technology through open source research and a commitment to academic excellence. Between each of these important discussions our colleagues at IOHK will take center stage.\n\n## Thought leadership\n\nIOHK\u2019s chief scientist, Aggelos Kiayias, and director of African operations John O\u2019Connor will talk about research and outreach in the Cardano Blockchain. Our panel entitled \u2018Haskell, then, now, and the future\u2019 will examine the impact the functional programming language has had and where it is heading. The virtual summit also serves as the launchpad for new advancements like \u2018Prism\u2019 our decentralized identity solution.

We will be discussing next steps for growing the Cardano community alongside oncoming blockchain regulations, governance, and opportunities. In combination, we hope the summit tracks will offer something for anyone interested in the future of Cardano, by the science and ideas that surround it, by the great minds making it all happen and by the incredible community that has brought us here and will take us forward.\n\nSessions will encompass the philosophical as well as the technical. Brian Behlendorf, the CEO of the Hyperledger Consortium will form part of a panel focused on the importance of open source development. IOHK recently [joined](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/11/why-we-are-joining-hyperledger/) the Hyperledger Consortium, to better exploit our common vision of a future made better through shared knowledge. Following on the philosophy track, artificial intelligence researcher, Ben Goertzel will speak on the intersection of AI and decentralized technology. We hope to announce more exciting sessions in the days leading up to the event. At the end of the day, building the next generation of technology means bringing the best minds of many fields into the same room, even if it\u2019s a virtual one.\n\n## Building community\n\nThe Cardano Virtual Summit 2020: Shelley Edition, won\u2019t be all work and no play. The Covid crisis has forced every conference online in past months. While we can\u2019t recreate the full physical conference experience in the virtual space, we\u2019re keen to provide some of the networking and downtime opportunities you might expect. So we\u2019ve added a virtual \u2018chill-out\u2019 zone, with guided meditations, a DJ set, and even an online calligraphy lesson/demonstration. Our virtual platform will allow attendees to enjoy the digital expo space through avatars. We\u2019ll even get the conversation flowing with a digital Shelley cocktail \u2018happy hour\u2019 between meetings.\n\nRecent events have made it difficult to meet in person but we see The Cardano Virtual Summit as an opportunity to invite everyone from around the world to participate. Attendance for anyone interested in the summit is absolutely free of charge. To join in, simply [reserve](https://www.ubivent.com/register/cardanovirtualsummit) your spot.\n\nShelley is the culmination of over 5 years of research and development, the creation of a multi-disciplinary team and a remarkable community. The virtual summit is just a single point of time \u2013 a time to take stock, reflect and celebrate.

Every presentation, panel and guest speaker at this online event, has been chosen to represent the many faces of Cardano. From world-class foundational research to the latest advances in cryptographic development; from the passion and dedication of the wider community to some of the innovators who have created our world and are lighting the path to the future. The event is meant to honor the hard work and dedication of the Cardano community, developers and contributors, and the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe virtual summit, much like IOHK\u2019s 2019 Miami summit will include presentations from IOHK team members, special guest appearances by thought leaders and a keynote speech by IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson. We were proud to announce that our guest of honor is internet co-creator and lead internet evangelist for Google, Vint Cerf. As one of the lead architects of the internet Vint is uniquely positioned to give us insight into building world changing technology.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be joined by Caitlin Long of the Wyoming Blockchain Select Committee. The Wall Street professional turned crypto pioneer has been blazing the trail for adoption in the state of Wyoming. She will give us a look at the challenges and opportunities she has faced while pushing for wider adoption of decentralization. Our final special guest, Stephen Wolfram is the creator of the computational knowledge platform Wolfram Alpha and the CEO of Wolfram Research. Cardano shares his dedication to advancing technology through open source research and a commitment to academic excellence.

He recently sat down for an interview to discuss the upcoming Byron reboot, the Haskell Shelley testnet, and the conclusion of the pre-Shelley development cycle. Coutts, who has been working with IOHK since 2016, brings a wealth of knowledge from working with the Haskell programming language for nearly 20 years and helping found the Well-Typed consultancy.\n\n**What\u2019s your role at IOHK?**\n\nI\u2019m the chief technical architect for the Cardano project and I\u2019m primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the node. This means that I collaborate with the teams that work on consensus, ledger, networking, and other things. Ultimately, I work to bring everyone together around the same design after a discussion with the team leaders. The design of Cardano is the product of joint work by many individuals working together.\n\n**What does the Haskell programming language bring to Cardano?**\n\nHaskell is an enabler. It makes it easier for us to follow the approach that we believe is right, which is driven by computer science. We know how to do things properly; computer science tells us how. We just need to pick the appropriate techniques to do that. Haskell makes that easier.\n\nIt\u2019s a good fit for Cardano because it suits the high-assurance, specification-driven software that is vital for a blockchain. Haskell helps us find systematic ways of avoiding mistakes. In essence, it\u2019s a better mousetrap.\n\n**You\u2019ve been working with Haskell for a long time. How have you seen the landscape of functional programming change?**\n\nPeople take it seriously now. When I started as an undergraduate in 1999, I thought that Haskell was amazing. Other students thought, \u2018Wow that\u2019s totally impractical. How will you ever get a job?\u2019\n\nAt the time, functional programming was an academic curiosity. There wasn\u2019t any prebuilt code and it wasn\u2019t machine readable, which meant that Haskell wasn\u2019t usable for a wide range of people. There wasn\u2019t the tooling, range of libraries, or experience. That has changed over the years: the tooling got better, the libraries got better. IOHK has helped develop the infrastructure for building and distributing open-source Haskell code and the number of libraries exploded. That, combined with more teaching and a gradual change of attitude in the industry, means that people take it more seriously now. Haskell hasn\u2019t changed as much as the industry around us has.\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest change from an industry point of view?**\n\nThere are two things. The first is that attitudes are changing, albeit slowly. People are changing their opinions about what they consider a sensible language choice. Previously, everything had to be in C or Java or maybe Python, but eventually good ideas make progress, even if it takes a long time. You can make a lot of progress by just recognizing that a good idea is a good idea. The mainstream does pick up on important developments, even if it does take 10 or 15 years. The industry has not embraced functional programming wholesale yet, but individual programmers have taken up various ideas. That makes Haskell look less radical.\n\nIf you look at a language like Rust, it has some of the clever type systems of Haskell, although it doesn\u2019t have any functional programming ideas. Even Java and C++ have some functional programming ideas in them these days, so Haskell is not quite so far from the mainstream as it used to be.\n\nThe second major change has been performance, which is getting much better. We\u2019ve recently become competitive with Java in terms of performance. It makes people say, \u2018Wow, Haskell is so fast,\u2019 but that\u2019s because they\u2019re comparing it to Python and PHP rather than C. So that\u2019s another way of saying that Haskell has improved slightly, but the industry environment around it has changed as well.\n\n**You have been heavily involved in the Byron reboot which was kicked off last week. Why was this work important?**\n\nThe [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/) is the culmination of over 18 months of hard work across multiple IOHK development teams, and constitutes a complete overhaul of the node infrastructure with 100% fresh code. The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself. The Byron reboot will go a long way to improving things, and users should see Daedalus syncing and restoring wallets within minutes, even when downloading the entire Cardano blockchain.\n\n**As the chief architect, your job is to lay the foundation for Cardano\u2019s future. What have you focused on to achieve this?**\n\nThe most important aspect in terms of flexibility for the future is keeping different functions separate. One of the big improvements of the Byron reboot is that the ledger rules will be totally independent of the consensus implementation; this modularity means that the ledger rules are perfectly clean mathematical functions, which is a core aspect of functional programming.\n\nAs a result, everything is easier to test, tweak, and change, both now and in the future. The consensus algorithm isn\u2019t entangled with the details of the ledger rules, so we can alter the ledger rules without changing the consensus implementation. This makes integrating Plutus and smart contracts functionality much easier and will also help in the future when we are adding treasury and governance features.\n\nThe consensus implementation itself has also been parameterized so that we can transition from the Ouroboros Classic consensus protocol to BFT and then Praos, which also provides flexibility for future versions of the protocol that haven't been developed yet.\n\n**Shelley is a big step towards the future of Cardano, but what is the significance of compiling Haskell into JavaScript and WebAssembly?**\n\nWe\u2019re interested in compiling to JavaScript or WebAssembly because of Plutus. We want to have Plutus contracts or Plutus applications that can be distributed to users, which would include custom interfaces and custom logic with the user rather than in a server. Compiling to JavaScript allows us to do that; you can compile the Plutus code once and distribute it to users on different platforms.\n\n- - -\n\nThanks to Duncan Coutts for his time. As chief technical architect, he\u2019s a cornerstone of the Cardano project and has been fundamental to the ongoing success of the platform.

The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself. The Byron reboot will go a long way to improving things, and users should see Daedalus syncing and restoring wallets within minutes, even when downloading the entire Cardano blockchain.\n\n**As the chief architect, your job is to lay the foundation for Cardano\u2019s future. What have you focused on to achieve this?**\n\nThe most important aspect in terms of flexibility for the future is keeping different functions separate. One of the big improvements of the Byron reboot is that the ledger rules will be totally independent of the consensus implementation; this modularity means that the ledger rules are perfectly clean mathematical functions, which is a core aspect of functional programming.\n\nAs a result, everything is easier to test, tweak, and change, both now and in the future. The consensus algorithm isn\u2019t entangled with the details of the ledger rules, so we can alter the ledger rules without changing the consensus implementation. This makes integrating Plutus and smart contracts functionality much easier and will also help in the future when we are adding treasury and governance features.\n\nThe consensus implementation itself has also been parameterized so that we can transition from the Ouroboros Classic consensus protocol to BFT and then Praos, which also provides flexibility for future versions of the protocol that haven't been developed yet.\n\n**Shelley is a big step towards the future of Cardano, but what is the significance of compiling Haskell into JavaScript and WebAssembly?**\n\nWe\u2019re interested in compiling to JavaScript or WebAssembly because of Plutus. We want to have Plutus contracts or Plutus applications that can be distributed to users, which would include custom interfaces and custom logic with the user rather than in a server. Compiling to JavaScript allows us to do that; you can compile the Plutus code once and distribute it to users on different platforms.\n\n- - -\n\nThanks to Duncan Coutts for his time. As chief technical architect, he\u2019s a cornerstone of the Cardano project and has been fundamental to the ongoing success of the platform.

The first answer to a problem is rarely the best, and any enterprise-focused solution cannot be gated by complexity or threaten network security.\n\n## Bringing functional programming to smart contracts with Plutus\n\nWe\u2019re big fans of functional programming here at IOHK and are proud to be able to say that the code underpinning the Cardano network is written in Haskell, the world\u2019s foremost functional programming language. Plutus is no different. Compared to their object-oriented counterparts, functional programming languages are less prone to ambiguity and human error \u2013 always a good thing \u2013 as well as being easier to verify and test. By using Plutus to write smart contracts on the Cardano network, developers benefit from all of the above, as well as the ability to use the same language for both on and off-chain code.\n\nWhile developers will have to wait for the Goguen era to launch smart contracts on the Cardano network, they can begin testing their smart contract skills in the [Plutus Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/plutus/tools/playground/ \"Plutus Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"). IOHK has also created a [Plutus ebook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plutus-Writing-reliable-smart-contracts-ebook/dp/B07V46LWTW \"Plutus ebook, amazon.com\") and [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/ \"Plutus Udemy course, udemy.com\") to help developers hit the ground running once Plutus is available on the Cardano mainnet.\n\n## And bringing Plutus to everyone with Marlowe\n\nThe problem with smart contracts, however, is that sometimes the people who know how to write the code don\u2019t have the industry expertise to know how to structure the contracts themselves. Enter Marlowe, IOHK\u2019s domain-specific language (DSL). Marlowe is designed for use by anyone that wants to write a financial smart contract without the programming skills to implement it. Users can try out Marlowe via the [Marlowe Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/marlowe/get-started/sample-marlowe-smart-contracts/ \"Marlowe Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"), a web utility with a user-friendly GUI and drag and drop components, where they can create financial smart contracts which, when complete, will generate fully-functional, implementation-ready Plutus code.\n\nMarlowe gives anyone the ability to gain familiarity with smart contracts while protecting them from unexpected outcomes. It also protects the developer and the system by ensuring that ill-formed smart contracts cannot be run. Finally, Marlowe focuses on commitment-of-funds and time-outs. These make certain that both parties have dedicated funds in the agreement while ensuring that money will not be left in the system after a contract has concluded.\n\n## Laying solid foundations\n\nPlutus, Marlowe, and the Cardano ecosystem continue to evolve to provide the safest and most efficient conditions to build decentralized applications. The next generations of Plutus and Marlowe will be announced at the WyoHackathon at the University of Wyoming on September 20, ahead of their release on mainnet at the start of the Goguen era. Marlowe advances include a high-fidelity development system that aids the writing of executable contracts and the new iteration of Plutus will allow users to access their contracts from web or mobile applications.

Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

This week, building on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://developers.cardano.org/en/virtual-machines/welcome/), we\u2019re rolling out a new [development environment](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/) to support the Glow language.*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau of Mutual Knowledge Systems is the creator of Glow, a DSL that will allow anyone to write verifiable DApps from a single spec and deploy it on our EVM network. We caught up with Rideau (also known as Fare) to hear more about his vision for Glow and the Cardano journey so far. The following is a distillation of his thoughts from our previous interviews.*\n\n\n\n**We first introduced the community to GLOW and MuKn at the end of [last year](https://youtu.be/lj9SlvOIBgU?t=2902) when we announced our devnets approach \u2013\u00a0 but maybe you can remind us how you began working with IOHK?**\n\nI started as a researcher in formal methods for programming languages and distributed systems. But I wanted to build systems actually used by many, so I moved into the industry where I notably worked on proving the correctness of a centralized payment protocol and creating an airline reservation system. After a few years at Google and Bridgewater, I decided life wasn\u2019t worth working under dysfunctional hierarchies, so I started my own cryptocurrency companies. Charles invited me to speak at the IOHK Summit 2019, and I realized how much I like the Cardano community: we have a similar focus on building robust software for the long term. That is why I wanted to port my domain specific language Glow to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Tell us a bit why you started your company Mutual Knowledge Systems, or as you call it MuKn (Moon)?**\n\nOver three years ago, I was reviewing whitepapers. Most papers (about \u00be) had interesting techniques but made no economic sense. Most of the rest (about \u2155) made economic sense but had no technical content. Only the top few (about 5%) actually made sense both technically and economically. At some point, I realized I could do better, so I designed a scaling solution using lessons learned from working on Tezos. Arthur Breitman challenged me to use smart contracts instead of trying to modify his protocol. \n\nWhile trying to prove his challenge absurd, I instead found that he was right and I was wrong\u2014and I finally understood why and how to use smart contracts. I started a company around the resulting scaling solution, raised money, pivoted into building the scaling solution after the language capable of generating it from specification, fought with and fired my then-partner, became my own CEO, started a new company, and, after much struggle, finally found the right founding team. Together, we built Mutual Knowledge Systems around this new programming language, Glow\u2014designed to be much better than existing languages to write decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n**When you say \u2018better\u2019, what do you really mean?**\n\nWriting a DApp is the single hardest thing to do in the world. This is because you can\u2019t afford a mistake, or your users may lose significant funds. Furthermore, you are not confronting random situations, but active adversaries bent on attacking your code, who will contrive the very worst case scenarios to exploit for their profit. Yet, unlike the military, you can\u2019t hide your code or protect access to your networks: all the critical pieces are necessarily public. On top of that, extant programming tools are not designed for these constraints and even traditional formal methods lack essential concepts to express the issues at stake.\n\nThus, we decided to make new tools fit for the challenge. Our domain-specific language (DSL) drastically simplifies DApp development, by abstracting away all the common blockchain infrastructure, so you can focus on your problem domain (trading, derivatives, insurance, supply chain, etc.). Your DApps can be thousands of lines of code that your users can afford to audit, instead of millions of lines of code that require leaps of blind faith. And the programming model will enable developers, auditors and automated verification tools to reason at the level of abstraction of participants exchanging assets, rather than at that of packets of bytes shipped around the Internet.\n\n\n\n**What is it about Cardano and its community that appeals?**\n\nI started like everyone else, on Ethereum, because its ecosystem is already mature. However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s got great fundamentals.\n\n\n\n**Can you talk about how you hope Glow will change the DApp developer experience?**\n\nGlow is portable. Today it works on Cardano and Ethereum but in the future it will work with any blockchain that is sufficiently advanced to support smart contracts. That means that you can write your DApp once and it will run on whichever platform has the users and the liquidity you seek. You don\u2019t have to make a guess about where liquidity will be in the future then sink heavy investments to develop on a single chain that you bet your house on.\n\n\n\nWith Glow, developers can run their DApps on all blockchains. Glow will commoditize blockchains. Blockchains will then compete on technical and economic merits, not on user lock-in and inertia. And the value brought to users will increase.\n\n\n\n**What can the community expect from Glow?**\n\nWe have launched this early version of Glow on the Cardano EVM Devnet with a command-line interface. In many ways, it is not yet ready for use by end-users, but it can already demonstrate simple applications. Users can also see how they may write a 6 line application in Glow that would require hundreds of lines in a combination of Solidity and JavaScript. We have a roadmap over the next few months to add a lot of features: from ERC20 tokens (and, on Cardano, native tokens), to generalized state channels, to a web interface, to a more robust runtime, etc. Eventually, we want to become the development environment for all blockchain projects. And Glow is of course an open source software open to the community.\n\n**We\u2019re rolling out the integration with Glow with our EVM and devnet program, so what are some of the benefits of this?**\n\nThe Cardano EVM side-chain will enable arbitrary contracts to run on Cardano that use the mature EVM platform, without waiting for Plutus to deliver its promise, to achieve feature-parity, to be considered stable, etc. And Glow can run on this EVM side-chain and provide the simplicity, safety and portability in DApp development that were not available before.\n\n**What is the rollout process like and how can our community get involved if they want to?**\n\nGlow is still in development. There are some things that it can do already and some it can\u2019t do yet. We invite DApp developers to join the Glow community and use the language for what it can already do, and otherwise help us build the blockchain development environment of the future. You can build the missing features you need yourself, or contract MuKn to build them for you. Even if you can\u2019t code and have no budget, you can help write the documentation, or even just tell us where it isn\u2019t clear yet, or what features you need most so we know what to prioritize. Together, we can build great DApps that you just couldn\u2019t have achieved safely and within budget with previous tools.\n\n*If you\u2019re a developer, we encourage you to get involved with [Mutual Knowledge Systems and Glow](https://mukn.io/).

This week, building on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://developers.cardano.org/en/virtual-machines/welcome/), we\u2019re rolling out a new [development environment](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/) to support the Glow language.*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau of Mutual Knowledge Systems is the creator of Glow, a DSL that will allow anyone to write verifiable DApps from a single spec and deploy it on our EVM network. We caught up with Rideau (also known as Fare) to hear more about his vision for Glow and the Cardano journey so far. The following is a distillation of his thoughts from our previous interviews.*\n\n\n\n**We first introduced the community to GLOW and MuKn at the end of [last year](https://youtu.be/lj9SlvOIBgU?t=2902) when we announced our devnets approach \u2013\u00a0 but maybe you can remind us how you began working with IOHK?**\n\nI started as a researcher in formal methods for programming languages and distributed systems. But I wanted to build systems actually used by many, so I moved into the industry where I notably worked on proving the correctness of a centralized payment protocol and creating an airline reservation system. After a few years at Google and Bridgewater, I decided life wasn\u2019t worth working under dysfunctional hierarchies, so I started my own cryptocurrency companies. Charles invited me to speak at the IOHK Summit 2019, and I realized how much I like the Cardano community: we have a similar focus on building robust software for the long term. That is why I wanted to port my domain specific language Glow to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Tell us a bit why you started your company Mutual Knowledge Systems, or as you call it MuKn (Moon)?**\n\nOver three years ago, I was reviewing whitepapers. Most papers (about \u00be) had interesting techniques but made no economic sense. Most of the rest (about \u2155) made economic sense but had no technical content. Only the top few (about 5%) actually made sense both technically and economically. At some point, I realized I could do better, so I designed a scaling solution using lessons learned from working on Tezos. Arthur Breitman challenged me to use smart contracts instead of trying to modify his protocol. \n\nWhile trying to prove his challenge absurd, I instead found that he was right and I was wrong\u2014and I finally understood why and how to use smart contracts. I started a company around the resulting scaling solution, raised money, pivoted into building the scaling solution after the language capable of generating it from specification, fought with and fired my then-partner, became my own CEO, started a new company, and, after much struggle, finally found the right founding team. Together, we built Mutual Knowledge Systems around this new programming language, Glow\u2014designed to be much better than existing languages to write decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n**When you say \u2018better\u2019, what do you really mean?**\n\nWriting a DApp is the single hardest thing to do in the world. This is because you can\u2019t afford a mistake, or your users may lose significant funds. Furthermore, you are not confronting random situations, but active adversaries bent on attacking your code, who will contrive the very worst case scenarios to exploit for their profit. Yet, unlike the military, you can\u2019t hide your code or protect access to your networks: all the critical pieces are necessarily public. On top of that, extant programming tools are not designed for these constraints and even traditional formal methods lack essential concepts to express the issues at stake.\n\nThus, we decided to make new tools fit for the challenge. Our domain-specific language (DSL) drastically simplifies DApp development, by abstracting away all the common blockchain infrastructure, so you can focus on your problem domain (trading, derivatives, insurance, supply chain, etc.). Your DApps can be thousands of lines of code that your users can afford to audit, instead of millions of lines of code that require leaps of blind faith. And the programming model will enable developers, auditors and automated verification tools to reason at the level of abstraction of participants exchanging assets, rather than at that of packets of bytes shipped around the Internet.\n\n\n\n**What is it about Cardano and its community that appeals?**\n\nI started like everyone else, on Ethereum, because its ecosystem is already mature. However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not.

In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Decentralizing social media: a conversation with Ben Goertzel and Charles Hoskinson", "subtitle": "The minds behind SingularityNET and Cardano come together to explore a vision of the future of decentralization, AI, and social media.", "audio": null, "soundcloud": null, "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\n*At the end of 2020, we announced our collaboration with SingularityNET, in an exclusive [fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3O5F_CCT8c) between Charles Hoskinson and SingularityNET founder & CEO, Ben Goertzel.*\u00a0\n\n*SingularityNET recently shared further information on the partnership when they announced their exciting [Phase Two initiative](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a),* [](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a) *which includes a shift from Ethereum to Cardano, to achieve new network functionalities and launching a Stream of New AGI-ADA Tokens.*\n\n*Last week, Charles and Ben sat down again together in a special [SingularityNET podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNWJGGc7ESI). In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "decentralizing-social-media", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/02/05/decentralizing-social-media/", "read_time": 57}, {"publish_date": "2021-01-06T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/344fa779-3928-4439-870f-7977abbfec51/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": " Project Catalyst blasts off into 2021 ", "subtitle": "New fund will commit $500k in ada to find groundbreaking ideas which accelerate Cardano development", "audio": "", "soundcloud": [{"trackid": 987296944}], "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\nProject Catalyst is the first stage in our Voltaire roadmap, created to bring best-in-class governance to Cardano.

But it\u2019s not one that we can accomplish alone. That\u2019s why we are always on the lookout for relationships which help us build a global foundation for growth. So, we\u2019re thrilled to announce our hackathon challenge to support the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals (SDGs) designed to accelerate progress on fighting hunger, injustice, and climate change.\n\n## Sustainability and blockchain\n\nIn this hackathon challenge we aim to give the blockchain community an opportunity to make an impact on international development. The challenge will draw on IOHK\u2019s expertise in community-focused funding developed with Project Catalyst. This initiative brings innovation, voting, and decentralized funding to Cardano by crowdsourcing development proposals, and financing their implementation.\n\nIOHK and United Nations personnel will use the Project Catalyst platform to find and fund initiatives that align with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. These goals were adopted by 193 world leaders in 2015. Each of the 17 targets focus on ending extreme poverty and hunger, fighting inequality and injustice, and tackling climate change by 2030.\n\nThis IOHK-sponsored challenge hopes to promote projects based in the digitization of finance which increase the efficacy and transparency of funding for the UN\u2019s Decade of Action. In the run-up to the 2030 deadline for achieving the global sustainability goals, the UN is marking 75 years since its establishment. Given that the transnational organization works on global collective action problems it has engaged with blockchain technology as a solution.\n\n## Crowdsourcing the future\n\nParticipants in the program can put forward ideas focused on any of the 17 goals. To encourage participation, IOHK is sponsoring a prize fund of ada worth $10,000 as well as ongoing support to bring the projects to fruition. Proposals will be judged by a panel of IOHK and UN employees. They will determine the winners based on an idea\u2019s technical prowess, scalability and social impact, as well as its financial and volunteer support. The winning ideas will be able to seek the advice of experts from both the UN and IOHK to ensure that they are implemented in the most impactful way.\n\nTo qualify for the scheme, entries must be open source and be created for use on the Cardano blockchain. Example code should be written in Marlowe, a domain specific language developed for financial contracts on Cardano. These do not need to be fully coded submissions. Instead they can be ideas which inspire anyone to get involved with blockchain technology and sustainable development. The proposal submission period opens on Saturday October 10th. Participants must be registered by then in order to submit. Entries must be finalized by October 18 at 11:59 MDT.

But it\u2019s not one that we can accomplish alone. That\u2019s why we are always on the lookout for relationships which help us build a global foundation for growth. So, we\u2019re thrilled to announce our hackathon challenge to support the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals (SDGs) designed to accelerate progress on fighting hunger, injustice, and climate change.\n\n## Sustainability and blockchain\n\nIn this hackathon challenge we aim to give the blockchain community an opportunity to make an impact on international development. The challenge will draw on IOHK\u2019s expertise in community-focused funding developed with Project Catalyst. This initiative brings innovation, voting, and decentralized funding to Cardano by crowdsourcing development proposals, and financing their implementation.\n\nIOHK and United Nations personnel will use the Project Catalyst platform to find and fund initiatives that align with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. These goals were adopted by 193 world leaders in 2015. Each of the 17 targets focus on ending extreme poverty and hunger, fighting inequality and injustice, and tackling climate change by 2030.\n\nThis IOHK-sponsored challenge hopes to promote projects based in the digitization of finance which increase the efficacy and transparency of funding for the UN\u2019s Decade of Action. In the run-up to the 2030 deadline for achieving the global sustainability goals, the UN is marking 75 years since its establishment. Given that the transnational organization works on global collective action problems it has engaged with blockchain technology as a solution.\n\n## Crowdsourcing the future\n\nParticipants in the program can put forward ideas focused on any of the 17 goals. To encourage participation, IOHK is sponsoring a prize fund of ada worth $10,000 as well as ongoing support to bring the projects to fruition. Proposals will be judged by a panel of IOHK and UN employees. They will determine the winners based on an idea\u2019s technical prowess, scalability and social impact, as well as its financial and volunteer support. The winning ideas will be able to seek the advice of experts from both the UN and IOHK to ensure that they are implemented in the most impactful way.\n\nTo qualify for the scheme, entries must be open source and be created for use on the Cardano blockchain. Example code should be written in Marlowe, a domain specific language developed for financial contracts on Cardano. These do not need to be fully coded submissions. Instead they can be ideas which inspire anyone to get involved with blockchain technology and sustainable development. The proposal submission period opens on Saturday October 10th. Participants must be registered by then in order to submit. Entries must be finalized by October 18 at 11:59 MDT.

Whatever the pace and cadence of future rollouts, we wanted to develop a consistent method by which all updates to the core node could be easily adopted by everyone.\n\nIn order to make that integration and interaction with Cardano easier and faster, IOHK engineers formed the Adrestia team, to take responsibility for building all the web APIs and libraries that make Cardano accessible to developers and application builders.

Exchanges or third-party wallets using Cardano-SL, should now be integrating to prepare for the new Byron and upgrading to Shelley wallet. These need to happen consecutively to avoid any outages.

Long time supporters of IOHK are likely familiar with his signature long hair, beard, and penchant for drinking tea while discussing decentralization in front of a [white board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZGVgNsJSnA&t=572s). He recently sat down for an interview to discuss the upcoming Byron reboot, the Haskell Shelley testnet, and the conclusion of the pre-Shelley development cycle. Coutts, who has been working with IOHK since 2016, brings a wealth of knowledge from working with the Haskell programming language for nearly 20 years and helping found the Well-Typed consultancy.\n\n**What\u2019s your role at IOHK?**\n\nI\u2019m the chief technical architect for the Cardano project and I\u2019m primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the node. This means that I collaborate with the teams that work on consensus, ledger, networking, and other things. Ultimately, I work to bring everyone together around the same design after a discussion with the team leaders. The design of Cardano is the product of joint work by many individuals working together.\n\n**What does the Haskell programming language bring to Cardano?**\n\nHaskell is an enabler. It makes it easier for us to follow the approach that we believe is right, which is driven by computer science. We know how to do things properly; computer science tells us how. We just need to pick the appropriate techniques to do that. Haskell makes that easier.\n\nIt\u2019s a good fit for Cardano because it suits the high-assurance, specification-driven software that is vital for a blockchain. Haskell helps us find systematic ways of avoiding mistakes. In essence, it\u2019s a better mousetrap.\n\n**You\u2019ve been working with Haskell for a long time. How have you seen the landscape of functional programming change?**\n\nPeople take it seriously now. When I started as an undergraduate in 1999, I thought that Haskell was amazing. Other students thought, \u2018Wow that\u2019s totally impractical. How will you ever get a job?\u2019\n\nAt the time, functional programming was an academic curiosity. There wasn\u2019t any prebuilt code and it wasn\u2019t machine readable, which meant that Haskell wasn\u2019t usable for a wide range of people. There wasn\u2019t the tooling, range of libraries, or experience. That has changed over the years: the tooling got better, the libraries got better. IOHK has helped develop the infrastructure for building and distributing open-source Haskell code and the number of libraries exploded. That, combined with more teaching and a gradual change of attitude in the industry, means that people take it more seriously now. Haskell hasn\u2019t changed as much as the industry around us has.\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest change from an industry point of view?**\n\nThere are two things. The first is that attitudes are changing, albeit slowly. People are changing their opinions about what they consider a sensible language choice. Previously, everything had to be in C or Java or maybe Python, but eventually good ideas make progress, even if it takes a long time. You can make a lot of progress by just recognizing that a good idea is a good idea. The mainstream does pick up on important developments, even if it does take 10 or 15 years. The industry has not embraced functional programming wholesale yet, but individual programmers have taken up various ideas. That makes Haskell look less radical.\n\nIf you look at a language like Rust, it has some of the clever type systems of Haskell, although it doesn\u2019t have any functional programming ideas. Even Java and C++ have some functional programming ideas in them these days, so Haskell is not quite so far from the mainstream as it used to be.\n\nThe second major change has been performance, which is getting much better. We\u2019ve recently become competitive with Java in terms of performance. It makes people say, \u2018Wow, Haskell is so fast,\u2019 but that\u2019s because they\u2019re comparing it to Python and PHP rather than C. So that\u2019s another way of saying that Haskell has improved slightly, but the industry environment around it has changed as well.\n\n**You have been heavily involved in the Byron reboot which was kicked off last week. Why was this work important?**\n\nThe [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/) is the culmination of over 18 months of hard work across multiple IOHK development teams, and constitutes a complete overhaul of the node infrastructure with 100% fresh code. The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself.

Long time supporters of IOHK are likely familiar with his signature long hair, beard, and penchant for drinking tea while discussing decentralization in front of a [white board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZGVgNsJSnA&t=572s). He recently sat down for an interview to discuss the upcoming Byron reboot, the Haskell Shelley testnet, and the conclusion of the pre-Shelley development cycle. Coutts, who has been working with IOHK since 2016, brings a wealth of knowledge from working with the Haskell programming language for nearly 20 years and helping found the Well-Typed consultancy.\n\n**What\u2019s your role at IOHK?**\n\nI\u2019m the chief technical architect for the Cardano project and I\u2019m primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the node. This means that I collaborate with the teams that work on consensus, ledger, networking, and other things. Ultimately, I work to bring everyone together around the same design after a discussion with the team leaders. The design of Cardano is the product of joint work by many individuals working together.\n\n**What does the Haskell programming language bring to Cardano?**\n\nHaskell is an enabler. It makes it easier for us to follow the approach that we believe is right, which is driven by computer science. We know how to do things properly; computer science tells us how. We just need to pick the appropriate techniques to do that. Haskell makes that easier.\n\nIt\u2019s a good fit for Cardano because it suits the high-assurance, specification-driven software that is vital for a blockchain. Haskell helps us find systematic ways of avoiding mistakes. In essence, it\u2019s a better mousetrap.\n\n**You\u2019ve been working with Haskell for a long time. How have you seen the landscape of functional programming change?**\n\nPeople take it seriously now. When I started as an undergraduate in 1999, I thought that Haskell was amazing. Other students thought, \u2018Wow that\u2019s totally impractical. How will you ever get a job?\u2019\n\nAt the time, functional programming was an academic curiosity. There wasn\u2019t any prebuilt code and it wasn\u2019t machine readable, which meant that Haskell wasn\u2019t usable for a wide range of people. There wasn\u2019t the tooling, range of libraries, or experience. That has changed over the years: the tooling got better, the libraries got better. IOHK has helped develop the infrastructure for building and distributing open-source Haskell code and the number of libraries exploded. That, combined with more teaching and a gradual change of attitude in the industry, means that people take it more seriously now. Haskell hasn\u2019t changed as much as the industry around us has.\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest change from an industry point of view?**\n\nThere are two things. The first is that attitudes are changing, albeit slowly. People are changing their opinions about what they consider a sensible language choice. Previously, everything had to be in C or Java or maybe Python, but eventually good ideas make progress, even if it takes a long time. You can make a lot of progress by just recognizing that a good idea is a good idea. The mainstream does pick up on important developments, even if it does take 10 or 15 years. The industry has not embraced functional programming wholesale yet, but individual programmers have taken up various ideas. That makes Haskell look less radical.\n\nIf you look at a language like Rust, it has some of the clever type systems of Haskell, although it doesn\u2019t have any functional programming ideas. Even Java and C++ have some functional programming ideas in them these days, so Haskell is not quite so far from the mainstream as it used to be.\n\nThe second major change has been performance, which is getting much better. We\u2019ve recently become competitive with Java in terms of performance. It makes people say, \u2018Wow, Haskell is so fast,\u2019 but that\u2019s because they\u2019re comparing it to Python and PHP rather than C. So that\u2019s another way of saying that Haskell has improved slightly, but the industry environment around it has changed as well.\n\n**You have been heavily involved in the Byron reboot which was kicked off last week. Why was this work important?**\n\nThe [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/) is the culmination of over 18 months of hard work across multiple IOHK development teams, and constitutes a complete overhaul of the node infrastructure with 100% fresh code. The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself. The Byron reboot will go a long way to improving things, and users should see Daedalus syncing and restoring wallets within minutes, even when downloading the entire Cardano blockchain.\n\n**As the chief architect, your job is to lay the foundation for Cardano\u2019s future.

Plutus is no different. Compared to their object-oriented counterparts, functional programming languages are less prone to ambiguity and human error \u2013 always a good thing \u2013 as well as being easier to verify and test. By using Plutus to write smart contracts on the Cardano network, developers benefit from all of the above, as well as the ability to use the same language for both on and off-chain code.\n\nWhile developers will have to wait for the Goguen era to launch smart contracts on the Cardano network, they can begin testing their smart contract skills in the [Plutus Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/plutus/tools/playground/ \"Plutus Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"). IOHK has also created a [Plutus ebook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plutus-Writing-reliable-smart-contracts-ebook/dp/B07V46LWTW \"Plutus ebook, amazon.com\") and [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/ \"Plutus Udemy course, udemy.com\") to help developers hit the ground running once Plutus is available on the Cardano mainnet.\n\n## And bringing Plutus to everyone with Marlowe\n\nThe problem with smart contracts, however, is that sometimes the people who know how to write the code don\u2019t have the industry expertise to know how to structure the contracts themselves. Enter Marlowe, IOHK\u2019s domain-specific language (DSL). Marlowe is designed for use by anyone that wants to write a financial smart contract without the programming skills to implement it. Users can try out Marlowe via the [Marlowe Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/marlowe/get-started/sample-marlowe-smart-contracts/ \"Marlowe Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"), a web utility with a user-friendly GUI and drag and drop components, where they can create financial smart contracts which, when complete, will generate fully-functional, implementation-ready Plutus code.\n\nMarlowe gives anyone the ability to gain familiarity with smart contracts while protecting them from unexpected outcomes. It also protects the developer and the system by ensuring that ill-formed smart contracts cannot be run. Finally, Marlowe focuses on commitment-of-funds and time-outs. These make certain that both parties have dedicated funds in the agreement while ensuring that money will not be left in the system after a contract has concluded.\n\n## Laying solid foundations\n\nPlutus, Marlowe, and the Cardano ecosystem continue to evolve to provide the safest and most efficient conditions to build decentralized applications. The next generations of Plutus and Marlowe will be announced at the WyoHackathon at the University of Wyoming on September 20, ahead of their release on mainnet at the start of the Goguen era. Marlowe advances include a high-fidelity development system that aids the writing of executable contracts and the new iteration of Plutus will allow users to access their contracts from web or mobile applications.

Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

Cardano and the Nervos Network. Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the [Nervos website](https://www.nervos.org/) for more information on upcoming partnerships and research initiatives.*\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/06/02/nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano/", "read_time": 3}, {"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": {"title": "Shruti Appiah", "display_name": "", "thumbnail": "https://ucarecdn.com/4df5ffe0-0a4a-4003-89e2-eb9a499b5155/", "is_team_member": true, "is_active": true, "localized": [{"job_titles": [{"name": "Product Manager", "primary": true}, {"name": "Engineering", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrutiappiah/", "twitter": "", "github": "https://github.com/ShrutiAppiah"}}], "job_titles": [{"name": "Product Manager", "primary": true}, {"name": "Engineering", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrutiappiah/", "twitter": "", "github": "https://github.com/ShrutiAppiah"}, "profile_url": "/blog/authors/shruti-appiah/", "blog_posts": [{"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/84e114f9-431a-4539-8ede-c18b883446d7/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe

Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users.

Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe (starting June 3rd), you can [register on our website](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/) for these webinars now!*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/", "read_time": 6}, {"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/84e114f9-431a-4539-8ede-c18b883446d7/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

"Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe

execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe (starting June 3rd), you can [register on our website](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/) for these webinars now!*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/", "read_time": 6}], "total_pages": 44, "current_page": 2, "filters": {"2016": {"10": 4, "12": 1, "__total": 23, "09": 5, "08": 3, "07": 5, "05": 2, "01": 3}, "2017": {"10": 7, "11": 2, "12": 5, "__total": 43, "09": 3, "08": 4, "07": 3, "06": 2, "05": 2, "04": 2, "03": 6, "02": 6, "01": 1}, "2018": {"10": 4, "12": 5, "__total": 37, "09": 1, "08": 3, "07": 3, "06": 3, "05": 4, "04": 3, "03": 3, "02": 4, "01": 4}, "2019": {"10": 1, "11": 1, "12": 1, "__total": 24, "09": 4, "07": 4, "06": 2, "05": 2, "04": 4, "03": 1, "02": 2, "01": 2}, "2020": {"10": 6, "11": 7, "12": 11, "__total": 56, "09": 3, "08": 2, "07": 4, "06": 6, "05": 5, "04": 4, "03": 3, "02": 4, "01": 1}, "2021": {"__total": 35, "06": 2, "05": 6, "04": 8, "03": 7, "02": 7, "01": 5}}, "crumbs": [{"path": "/blog/posts/page-1/", "name": "blog_posts", "active": true}]}}}

These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways.

So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "a-close-look-at-the-software-running-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/06/08/a-close-look-at-the-software-running-cardano/", "read_time": 5}, {"publish_date": "2021-06-02T00:00:00.000Z", "author": {"title": "Eric Czuleger", "display_name": null, "thumbnail": "https://ucarecdn.com/fd70c3a0-974f-406f-88e2-a9956d82cc86/", "is_team_member": true, "is_active": true, "localized": [{"job_titles": [{"name": "Senior Content Editor", "primary": null}, {"name": "Marketing & Communications", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "eric.czuleger@iohk.io", "youtube": null, "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-czuleger-6b67a395/", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/eczuleger", "github": null}}], "job_titles": [{"name": "Senior Content Editor", "primary": null}, {"name": "Marketing & Communications", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "eric.czuleger@iohk.io", "youtube": null, "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-czuleger-6b67a395/", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/eczuleger", "github": null}, "profile_url": "/blog/authors/eric-czuleger/", "blog_posts": []}, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/a654b860-da1e-415c-8eb9-0b6188229740/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Nervos partnership to build the first cross-chain bridge with Cardano", "subtitle": " Our new collab lets Cardano and Nervos token holders transmit their value across both platforms while building interoperability across the crypto space", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [{"trackid": 1060596082}], "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\nIOHK and Nervos are teaming up to build a bridge of interoperability between Cardano and the Nervos Network. Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

Cardano and the Nervos Network. Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the [Nervos website](https://www.nervos.org/) for more information on upcoming partnerships and research initiatives.*\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/06/02/nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano/", "read_time": 3}, {"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": {"title": "Shruti Appiah", "display_name": "", "thumbnail": "https://ucarecdn.com/4df5ffe0-0a4a-4003-89e2-eb9a499b5155/", "is_team_member": true, "is_active": true, "localized": [{"job_titles": [{"name": "Product Manager", "primary": true}, {"name": "Engineering", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrutiappiah/", "twitter": "", "github": "https://github.com/ShrutiAppiah"}}], "job_titles": [{"name": "Product Manager", "primary": true}, {"name": "Engineering", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrutiappiah/", "twitter": "", "github": "https://github.com/ShrutiAppiah"}, "profile_url": "/blog/authors/shruti-appiah/", "blog_posts": []}, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/84e114f9-431a-4539-8ede-c18b883446d7/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe

execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe (starting June 3rd), you can [register on our website](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/) for these webinars now!*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/", "read_time": 6}, {"publish_date": "2021-05-17T00:00:00.000Z", "author": {"title": "Francisco Landino", "display_name": null, "thumbnail": "https://ucarecdn.com/ecf233e0-54bf-4189-86e3-acaefa2f2762/", "is_team_member": true, "is_active": true, "localized": [{"job_titles": [{"name": "Project Manager", "primary": null}, {"name": "Commercial", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "francisco.landino@iohk.io", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-landino/", "twitter": null, "github": "https://github.com/plandino"}}], "job_titles": [{"name": "Project Manager", "primary": null}, {"name": "Commercial", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "francisco.landino@iohk.io", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-landino/", "twitter": null, "github": "https://github.com/plandino"}, "profile_url": "/blog/authors/francisco-landino/", "blog_posts": []}, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/0e068caf-0cb7-44cc-9ded-858d7b3b2fc2/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Bringing ERC20 to Cardano", "subtitle": "Our new ERC20 converter will allow Ethereum tokens like AGI to run on our proof-of-stake blockchain \u2013 coming soon to testnet", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [{"trackid": 1050304474}], "body_content": "Connecting blockchain protocols and collaborating on applications are essential to achieving the promise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and provide an alternative to the traditional banking system.\n\nAccording to DeFi Pulse, a tracking website, cryptocurrency to a total value of over \u2018[$75 billion is now locked up](https://defipulse.com/)\u2019 in DeFi. A year ago, the total was just $700 million. Most of this value is in the form of crypto-assets based on the ERC20 token standard. \n\nBut Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work infrastructure is challenged with ever-rising costs. We foresaw this issue and providing an alternative was one of the founding principles we set for Cardano. This is about to come into fruition.\n\nTo expand the variety of use cases for application developers and businesses, Cardano will support the ERC20 token migration to its platform. The Alonzo hard fork and Plutus smart contracts are on the way. Once deployed, users of supported Ethereum tokens will be able to bring them over from Ethereum's congested network and take advantage of Cardano's transaction capacity and lower fees, while enjoying enhanced security, reduced cost, and interoperability. \n\n## Why ERC20?\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the nature of ERC20 to understand why this standard fits the market trends in terms of business needs. First, of course, Ethereum brought the concept of smart contracts and \u2018programmable money\u2019 to the blockchain in 2015. Since then, tokenization and the ERC20 token have gained popularity because of utility in everyday business transactions. Applications built on a blockchain can provide tokens that can serve as:\n\n* a payment unit\n* a transaction unit\n* access to digital services\n* a reward or incentive \n* a right to vote \n* an investment mechanism\n\nWell-designed ERC20 tokens address many needs, and the more useful they become, the more demand grows and so their value grows accordingly. That is why these tokens are widely used and are so well supported by wallets and exchanges. \n\n## Ethereum v Cardano\n\nThe ERC20 standard was invented for Ethereum, and as of today, there are [over 400,000 contracts based on this token standard](https://etherscan.io/tokens) with examples including Binance coin (BNB), Tether (USDT), Uniswap (UNI), and Dai (DAI) to name a few. \n\nEthereum is a popular and functional blockchain platform, but it is slowing down and becoming more expensive. As more network participants interact with decentralized applications, the \u2018gas\u2019 fees paid for validating transactions are rising sharply (Figure 1).\n\n![Ethereum gas fees ](https://ucarecdn.com/2249a759-2ead-46e5-8c9b-5cd4a33ea8c2/ \"Ethereum gas fees are increasing\")\n\nFigure 1. Ethereum gas fees are increasing\n\nThe problems being experienced by Ethereum users have also been identified by a Cointelegraph survey cited in \u2018[DeFi Adoption 2020](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/48c6c4e03f85bc722d76f88c2676478b.pdf?_ga=2.42938214.270418488.1602500005-1231871226.1593587737)\u2019:\n\n> 45% of platforms built on Ethereum name scalability and high gas costs among the top three problems constraining mass DeFi adoption.\n\nEthereum has not yet resolved these challenges and is unlikely to do so in the short term. So many businesses will want to consider other options. \n\n*By enabling the migration of ERC20 tokens to Cardano, we focus on delivering a value proposition that leverages Cardano\u2019s advantages over Ethereum. In particular, Cardano's higher capacity for transaction processing and lower fees when compared with Ethereum's high cost and often congested traffic.*\n\n## Enabled by Ouroboros\n\nThe key to addressing the problem of network congestion and high fees is Cardano\u2019s Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Compared with Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work protocol, Ouroboros needs far less energy to process network transactions; it runs using amounts of electricity on the scale of a large house, rather than a small country. \nBecause of this, Ouroboros is not only eco-friendly but also needs far lower fees to process transactions. \n\nAdditionally, Cardano does not require smart contract execution costs as the ledger supports native token functionality with its built-in accounting model. This means that the tracking, transfer, and ownership of different types of assets are handled by the ledger instead of smart contracts. Whereas the creation and transfer of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum require the manual modification of the standard contract type, the logic for this is built into Cardano, which also eliminates the risk of errors and vulnerabilities.\n\n## How the ERC20 converter works\n\nCardano currently supports ada and [native tokens](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/18/building-native-tokens-on-cardano-for-pleasure-and-profit/), which have proven successful with over 160,000 tokens minted. We are now launching an ERC20 converter to ensure better interoperability in the future as well as lay a solid background for extended business opportunities.\n\nOur ERC20 converter is a tool that will allow issuing organizations and their users to handle ERC20 token migration to Cardano. It is designed for token issuers (organizations that wish to enable the migration of their tokens to Cardano), and their users (token holders) to use the tool to move their ERC20 tokens to the Cardano network.\n\nUsers can convert their Ethereum tokens in just a few clicks, and when moved across, these tokens will be \u2018translated\u2019 into a special native token on Cardano that has the same value and works just like an ERC20. Additionally, if the user wishes to do so at a later stage, they can move their tokens back to the source network by burning them on Cardano. Two-way convertibility is baked in. \n\nWe\u2019ll soon spin up a version of the ERC20 converter tool on a dedicated testnet. IO Global is currently working with partners for migration to Cardano, and [SingularityNET](https://singularitynet.io/) will be the first of these. The ERC20 converter will introduce a new [SingularityNET AGIX token](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-ii-launch-sequence-activated-agi-token-to-be-hard-forked-to-10ede4b6c89), the deployment of which marks the first milestone in the SingularityNET to Cardano migration plan. The initial testnet will allow users to assess the process of migration while working with AGIX tokens both in Cardano and Ethereum Kovan testnets.\n\nIt will be possible to authenticate an account using Metamask (an extension for the Chrome browser) with more options to come later. Users will also need to add their Daedalus testnet address so they can migrate their tokens to Cardano and easily track balances and transactions. \n\nWhen users log into their ERC20 converter account, they will see SingularityNET tokens listed and available for migration, and, by clicking on a token \u2012 details such as token balance. They will just need to select the token, indicate the amount they would like to convert, and then migrate them by specifying a Cardano address. When tokens migrate to the address, it will be possible to use them for payments and transactions from the Daedalus wallet. All the activities will be visible both within Etherscan and the Cardano Explorer. \n\n![ERC20 converter dashboard](https://ucarecdn.com/d9abae9f-25e6-4a67-a8c2-d453bc935074/ \"ERC20 converter dashboard\")\n\nFigure 2. ERC20 converter dashboard\n\nAt later stages, users will see different types of tokens within the dashboard. Tokens available for migration will be listed first, and if not yet eligible \u2013 it will be possible to subscribe for updates about any changes.\n\n## A glance ahead\n\nAs the number of ERC20 converter partnerships increases, the range of token types supported will grow. Currently, our partners need to be custodians of their tokens, however, we will achieve greater interoperability while onboarding organizations when Plutus smart contracts operate on mainnet. \n\nOur goal is to support many tokens to create possibilities for business deals. So, further down the road, with a variety of tokens, the ERC20 converter will act as a bridge between blockchains, and this will promote effective cross-chain communication. \n\n*The ERC20 converter testnet is now in the final stages of quality assurance testing before the public launch. This stage will allow us to test the user journey and improve their experience along with fixing any occurring issues. We will also soon provide the dedicated testnet environment with relevant documentation and instructions on how users can test the converter capabilities.* \n\n*We\u2019ll share an update on May\u2019s Cardano360 show.

achieving the promise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and provide an alternative to the traditional banking system.\n\nAccording to DeFi Pulse, a tracking website, cryptocurrency to a total value of over \u2018[$75 billion is now locked up](https://defipulse.com/)\u2019 in DeFi. A year ago, the total was just $700 million. Most of this value is in the form of crypto-assets based on the ERC20 token standard. \n\nBut Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work infrastructure is challenged with ever-rising costs. We foresaw this issue and providing an alternative was one of the founding principles we set for Cardano. This is about to come into fruition.\n\nTo expand the variety of use cases for application developers and businesses, Cardano will support the ERC20 token migration to its platform. The Alonzo hard fork and Plutus smart contracts are on the way. Once deployed, users of supported Ethereum tokens will be able to bring them over from Ethereum's congested network and take advantage of Cardano's transaction capacity and lower fees, while enjoying enhanced security, reduced cost, and interoperability. \n\n## Why ERC20?\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the nature of ERC20 to understand why this standard fits the market trends in terms of business needs. First, of course, Ethereum brought the concept of smart contracts and \u2018programmable money\u2019 to the blockchain in 2015. Since then, tokenization and the ERC20 token have gained popularity because of utility in everyday business transactions. Applications built on a blockchain can provide tokens that can serve as:\n\n* a payment unit\n* a transaction unit\n* access to digital services\n* a reward or incentive \n* a right to vote \n* an investment mechanism\n\nWell-designed ERC20 tokens address many needs, and the more useful they become, the more demand grows and so their value grows accordingly. That is why these tokens are widely used and are so well supported by wallets and exchanges. \n\n## Ethereum v Cardano\n\nThe ERC20 standard was invented for Ethereum, and as of today, there are [over 400,000 contracts based on this token standard](https://etherscan.io/tokens) with examples including Binance coin (BNB), Tether (USDT), Uniswap (UNI), and Dai (DAI) to name a few. \n\nEthereum is a popular and functional blockchain platform, but it is slowing down and becoming more expensive. As more network participants interact with decentralized applications, the \u2018gas\u2019 fees paid for validating transactions are rising sharply (Figure 1).\n\n![Ethereum gas fees ](https://ucarecdn.com/2249a759-2ead-46e5-8c9b-5cd4a33ea8c2/ \"Ethereum gas fees are increasing\")\n\nFigure 1. Ethereum gas fees are increasing\n\nThe problems being experienced by Ethereum users have also been identified by a Cointelegraph survey cited in \u2018[DeFi Adoption 2020](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/48c6c4e03f85bc722d76f88c2676478b.pdf?_ga=2.42938214.270418488.1602500005-1231871226.1593587737)\u2019:\n\n> 45% of platforms built on Ethereum name scalability and high gas costs among the top three problems constraining mass DeFi adoption.\n\nEthereum has not yet resolved these challenges and is unlikely to do so in the short term. So many businesses will want to consider other options. \n\n*By enabling the migration of ERC20 tokens to Cardano, we focus on delivering a value proposition that leverages Cardano\u2019s advantages over Ethereum. In particular, Cardano's higher capacity for transaction processing and lower fees when compared with Ethereum's high cost and often congested traffic.*\n\n## Enabled by Ouroboros\n\nThe key to addressing the problem of network congestion and high fees is Cardano\u2019s Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Compared with Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work protocol, Ouroboros needs far less energy to process network transactions; it runs using amounts of electricity on the scale of a large house, rather than a small country. \nBecause of this, Ouroboros is not only eco-friendly but also needs far lower fees to process transactions. \n\nAdditionally, Cardano does not require smart contract execution costs as the ledger supports native token functionality with its built-in accounting model. This means that the tracking, transfer, and ownership of different types of assets are handled by the ledger instead of smart contracts. Whereas the creation and transfer of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum require the manual modification of the standard contract type, the logic for this is built into Cardano, which also eliminates the risk of errors and vulnerabilities.\n\n## How the ERC20 converter works\n\nCardano currently supports ada and [native tokens](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/18/building-native-tokens-on-cardano-for-pleasure-and-profit/), which have proven successful with over 160,000 tokens minted. We are now launching an ERC20 converter to ensure better interoperability in the future as well as lay a solid background for extended business opportunities.\n\nOur ERC20 converter is a tool that will allow issuing organizations and their users to handle ERC20 token migration to Cardano. It is designed for token issuers (organizations that wish to enable the migration of their tokens to Cardano), and their users (token holders) to use the tool to move their ERC20 tokens to the Cardano network.\n\nUsers can convert their Ethereum tokens in just a few clicks, and when moved across, these tokens will be \u2018translated\u2019 into a special native token on Cardano that has the same value and works just like an ERC20. Additionally, if the user wishes to do so at a later stage, they can move their tokens back to the source network by burning them on Cardano. Two-way convertibility is baked in. \n\nWe\u2019ll soon spin up a version of the ERC20 converter tool on a dedicated testnet. IO Global is currently working with partners for migration to Cardano, and [SingularityNET](https://singularitynet.io/) will be the first of these. The ERC20 converter will introduce a new [SingularityNET AGIX token](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-ii-launch-sequence-activated-agi-token-to-be-hard-forked-to-10ede4b6c89), the deployment of which marks the first milestone in the SingularityNET to Cardano migration plan. The initial testnet will allow users to assess the process of migration while working with AGIX tokens both in Cardano and Ethereum Kovan testnets.\n\nIt will be possible to authenticate an account using Metamask (an extension for the Chrome browser) with more options to come later. Users will also need to add their Daedalus testnet address so they can migrate their tokens to Cardano and easily track balances and transactions. \n\nWhen users log into their ERC20 converter account, they will see SingularityNET tokens listed and available for migration, and, by clicking on a token \u2012 details such as token balance. They will just need to select the token, indicate the amount they would like to convert, and then migrate them by specifying a Cardano address. When tokens migrate to the address, it will be possible to use them for payments and transactions from the Daedalus wallet. All the activities will be visible both within Etherscan and the Cardano Explorer. \n\n![ERC20 converter dashboard](https://ucarecdn.com/d9abae9f-25e6-4a67-a8c2-d453bc935074/ \"ERC20 converter dashboard\")\n\nFigure 2. ERC20 converter dashboard\n\nAt later stages, users will see different types of tokens within the dashboard. Tokens available for migration will be listed first, and if not yet eligible \u2013 it will be possible to subscribe for updates about any changes.\n\n## A glance ahead\n\nAs the number of ERC20 converter partnerships increases, the range of token types supported will grow. Currently, our partners need to be custodians of their tokens, however, we will achieve greater interoperability while onboarding organizations when Plutus smart contracts operate on mainnet. \n\nOur goal is to support many tokens to create possibilities for business deals. So, further down the road, with a variety of tokens, the ERC20 converter will act as a bridge between blockchains, and this will promote effective cross-chain communication. \n\n*The ERC20 converter testnet is now in the final stages of quality assurance testing before the public launch.

Stake pools have always been the driving force of the Cardano network and we launched our delegation strategy to recognize and bootstrap the promising pools.\n\nTo support our long-term vision for Cardano\u2019s growth and network decentralization, we have already delegated the stake from retired IO Global pools to a number of promising stake pools in the ecosystem \u2013 to bootstrap their business and support community development goals, technical contributions, and geographical distribution. Our analysis has shown that our contribution helped them to become more stable in the network and attract delegators and community members who share their ideas and development objectives.\n\n## Diversity & distribution\n\nAny community ecosystem needs its engineers and entrepreneurs, its technocrats, and its diplomats \u2013 globally. Equally, the pool ecosystem needs a balance of larger established players, a strong core, and an inflow of new entrants primed to build further success upon strong fundamentals.\n\nThe problem that many stake pools currently face is their recognition within the ecosystem or rather visibility that allows the attraction of community support to ensure stable and consistent pool operation. Running a stake pool is not an easy process; unlike mining, it does not presume straightforward funds earning from just setting up a pool on the machine. You cannot buy your way to success through a better and better kit \u2013 indeed, Cardano is designed to be relatively light on computing resources. Stake pool operation is a complex business that has the hallmarks of both a commodity and a distributed market, and requires a blend of skills, persistence, and luck. \n\nThere are many factors that influence the pool\u2019s success and differentiate it from the others. First of all, these are technical factors such as:\n\n* **Parameters**:  this includes pledge influence factor, relative pool saturation size, stake delegated to the pool, and stake pledged by the owners.\n* **Fiscal**: variable fee, fixed fee, and pledge should be all taken into account to ensure that the pool functions effectively, produces blocks, and earns rewards for its delegators.\n* **Performance**: calculated according to the pool\u2019s expected activity as the ratio of the number of blocks a stake pool produces in a given epoch versus the number it was capable of producing.\n* **Overall mission**: even if the pool meets all of the above requirements, this does not mean that it becomes totally recognized or drives straightforward attention. With over 2000 active pools in the ecosystem, it is essential to reveal to the community the mission that a certain pool is trying to achieve and explain why this exact choice is beneficial for others.\n\nThe ability to differentiate is key, and that is where the **marketing** factor steps in. Just like any business seeking \u2018customers\u2019 in a competitive market, no pool will get recognized unless it announces itself, tells a story, builds trust. So, commitment to raising awareness sits alongside vigilance towards node maintenance. Like any small business \u2013 and that's what this is \u2013 it requires clear objectives, and of course, goals that add value to the community while meeting the bottom line. \n\n## Opportunities\n\nWe announced a new stage of application submission earlier in April, and are now committing to redelegate our funds to a new cohort of stake pools and \u2013 we hope \u2013 help them grow to their potential.\n\nEven though we may *want* every pool to be successful, not every pool will be. With our delegation, we are committing to help those stake pools that ultimately, have not yet reached the desired level of awareness. One of the critical issues a stake pool operator comes across is uncertainty and the inability to rely on consistent rewards. This is like with venture capital investments \u2013 stakeholders invest in those projects where they see returns on investment. But what if the mission is highly important and promising, but there is no capital to kick it off? In such cases, many companies receive initial support (investment) in order to boost their development and reach desired goals. \n\nIn the same way, we are willing to support promising stake pools, and help them get established within the ecosystem by evening out more predictable rewards and, thus, attracting a higher number of delegators to support their mission. \n\nDifferentiation is key to success, and we hope that we can provide the chosen stake pools with opportunities to establish themselves and keep sustainable and stable operations without relying on the luckiness factor. We can now share details of the fresh cohort of stake pools chosen to take part in our new delegation round. But first, a closer look into objectives and the process.\n\n## The process\n\nChoosing the pools for delegation is always a complex process. Every active pool is making a contribution to the globally decentralized network. Last time, when assessing the pools and their contributions, we have been guided by such factors as their goals and purpose, geographical location, technical contribution, stake & pledge ratio, and community/social media engagement. \n\nWith 700 pools to assess, we were always going to disappoint many pools and some may feel they have been unfairly overlooked. Even after some initial filtering, we had a field of some 300 pools that met many of the criteria we identified. Thanks again to [pooltool.io](https://pooltool.io/) and [adapools.org](https://adapools.org/) for providing additional data sources during the process.\n\nPurpose and mission remain an important part of Cardano so this was again part of the mix. Greater weight this time was also given towards other key aspects such as *geographic distribution*, *social/community activity*, and *support for the lower-middle sized part of the network*. Pragmatically, sustainable support needs to focus on pools that are neither strongest nor weakest. The following delegation distribution was defined:\n\n* 50% of our dedicated stake to the geographically distributed pools \n* 25% to socially active pools with solid technical potential\n* 25% to the lower-middle sized pools to even out the network balance\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the factors that influenced our choice to understand the reasoning behind it.\n\n**Geographical distribution**\n\nCardano is a decentralized, distributed network of nodes that work together to verify block production and transaction validity in the network. Decentralization is key to this process as only independence from governing entities establishes trust and confidence in handling financial activities. To ensure that the network is resilient to connectivity failures, it is essential that stake pool operation nodes are distributed across the globe without significant concentration in one location. This is beneficial for setting up connections between different regions and eliminates a single point of failure. A minimum of two relays was another factor in play as part of this.\n\n**Social/community activity**\n\nOur survey earlier in the year helped us understand that a critical issue SPOs face is the inability to differentiate. For this reason, we used a social impact score from [Pulsar](https://www.pulsarplatform.com/) to help us understand which stake pools were gaining traction across potential delegators. \n\nAs well as \u2018ambassadors\u2019 for the network, we have evaluated socially active stake pools that operate to support business goals in their countries or for the betterment of various community activities. We have chosen those pools that have great social presence and community engagement but face difficulties in gaining a stronger position in terms of reward predictability. To be clear, technical performance is still the most important factor \u2013 no amount of tweets or Reddit posts is going to make up for missed blocks.\n\n**Network balance**\n\nWith such a variety of stake pools all functioning for different purposes, we are also distinguishing potentially strong pools that have been working hard to keep the network activities and support block production and transaction validation. Delegating to these pools, we support smaller-middle size businesses and help their delegators earn stable rewards. \n\nDue to the security properties of the Ouroboros protocol, the selection process for block production is ultimately randomized, and the probability of creating a block is proportional to the amount of delegated stake.\n\nSuch a condition is well-applicable for long-term reward behavior, however, in terms of shorter timespans (one or several epochs), this randomness can yield an unpredictable amount of rewards. This effect increases the smaller amount of delegation the pool has, which in turn might have an undesired side effect disconcerting delegators who expect a predictable amount of return on their stake.\n\n## Meeting the winners\n\nHere\u2019s a list of 100 stake pools chosen for our new round of delegation. If you\u2019re interested to find out more about these pools and their mission, you can easily do so at [adafolio.com](https://adafolio.com/portfolio/c5df0868-b4cf-11eb-8c63-0242c0a86003) or [adapools.org](https://adapools.org/delegations/input-output). \n\n![delegation winners](https://ucarecdn.com/866682b7-e4df-4a94-ae50-ea78468ee214/ \"delegation winners\")\n\nWe are aiming to delegate to these pools at the end of May/early June, so SPOs can expect to receive ada from then for a period of three months. \n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAs much as we are happy to recognize 100 stake pools that we believe have solid potential in reaching business objectives and supporting ecosystem sustainability, we still understand that there are many more contributors that we are not able to delegate to this time. We would like to thank you for all you do and if you were not selected this time, please note that we\u2019ll have a new delegation round three months from now. \n\nSo, we encourage all pools that missed out to apply again for the fresh cohort during Q3, and we\u2019ll make a new call for applications in June to rotate delegations in July. While technical analysis is the primary way that pools are identified for delegation, we always welcome community feedback on how we can continue to improve the process. We are committed to seeing the Cardano ecosystem go from strength to strength. Together we have created the world\u2019s leading proof-of-stake ecosystem and we want to do what we can to maintain and improve it as it matures.\n\n*Thanks to Ben O\u2019Hanlon, Colin Edwards,

network, we are now announcing the new round of winners for delegation", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano continues to grow, powered by a stake pool operator (SPO) community working toward a vision of an independent, globally decentralized ecosystem. Stake pools have always been the driving force of the Cardano network and we launched our delegation strategy to recognize and bootstrap the promising pools.\n\nTo support our long-term vision for Cardano\u2019s growth and network decentralization, we have already delegated the stake from retired IO Global pools to a number of promising stake pools in the ecosystem \u2013 to bootstrap their business and support community development goals, technical contributions, and geographical distribution. Our analysis has shown that our contribution helped them to become more stable in the network and attract delegators and community members who share their ideas and development objectives.\n\n## Diversity & distribution\n\nAny community ecosystem needs its engineers and entrepreneurs, its technocrats, and its diplomats \u2013 globally. Equally, the pool ecosystem needs a balance of larger established players, a strong core, and an inflow of new entrants primed to build further success upon strong fundamentals.\n\nThe problem that many stake pools currently face is their recognition within the ecosystem or rather visibility that allows the attraction of community support to ensure stable and consistent pool operation. Running a stake pool is not an easy process; unlike mining, it does not presume straightforward funds earning from just setting up a pool on the machine. You cannot buy your way to success through a better and better kit \u2013 indeed, Cardano is designed to be relatively light on computing resources. Stake pool operation is a complex business that has the hallmarks of both a commodity and a distributed market, and requires a blend of skills, persistence, and luck. \n\nThere are many factors that influence the pool\u2019s success and differentiate it from the others. First of all, these are technical factors such as:\n\n* **Parameters**:  this includes pledge influence factor, relative pool saturation size, stake delegated to the pool, and stake pledged by the owners.\n* **Fiscal**: variable fee, fixed fee, and pledge should be all taken into account to ensure that the pool functions effectively, produces blocks, and earns rewards for its delegators.\n* **Performance**: calculated according to the pool\u2019s expected activity as the ratio of the number of blocks a stake pool produces in a given epoch versus the number it was capable of producing.\n* **Overall mission**: even if the pool meets all of the above requirements, this does not mean that it becomes totally recognized or drives straightforward attention. With over 2000 active pools in the ecosystem, it is essential to reveal to the community the mission that a certain pool is trying to achieve and explain why this exact choice is beneficial for others.\n\nThe ability to differentiate is key, and that is where the **marketing** factor steps in. Just like any business seeking \u2018customers\u2019 in a competitive market, no pool will get recognized unless it announces itself, tells a story, builds trust. So, commitment to raising awareness sits alongside vigilance towards node maintenance. Like any small business \u2013 and that's what this is \u2013 it requires clear objectives, and of course, goals that add value to the community while meeting the bottom line. \n\n## Opportunities\n\nWe announced a new stage of application submission earlier in April, and are now committing to redelegate our funds to a new cohort of stake pools and \u2013 we hope \u2013 help them grow to their potential.\n\nEven though we may *want* every pool to be successful, not every pool will be. With our delegation, we are committing to help those stake pools that ultimately, have not yet reached the desired level of awareness. One of the critical issues a stake pool operator comes across is uncertainty and the inability to rely on consistent rewards. This is like with venture capital investments \u2013 stakeholders invest in those projects where they see returns on investment. But what if the mission is highly important and promising, but there is no capital to kick it off? In such cases, many companies receive initial support (investment) in order to boost their development and reach desired goals. \n\nIn the same way, we are willing to support promising stake pools, and help them get established within the ecosystem by evening out more predictable rewards and, thus, attracting a higher number of delegators to support their mission. \n\nDifferentiation is key to success, and we hope that we can provide the chosen stake pools with opportunities to establish themselves and keep sustainable and stable operations without relying on the luckiness factor. We can now share details of the fresh cohort of stake pools chosen to take part in our new delegation round. But first, a closer look into objectives and the process.\n\n## The process\n\nChoosing the pools for delegation is always a complex process. Every active pool is making a contribution to the globally decentralized network. Last time, when assessing the pools and their contributions, we have been guided by such factors as their goals and purpose, geographical location, technical contribution, stake & pledge ratio, and community/social media engagement. \n\nWith 700 pools to assess, we were always going to disappoint many pools and some may feel they have been unfairly overlooked. Even after some initial filtering, we had a field of some 300 pools that met many of the criteria we identified. Thanks again to [pooltool.io](https://pooltool.io/) and [adapools.org](https://adapools.org/) for providing additional data sources during the process.\n\nPurpose and mission remain an important part of Cardano so this was again part of the mix. Greater weight this time was also given towards other key aspects such as *geographic distribution*, *social/community activity*, and *support for the lower-middle sized part of the network*. Pragmatically, sustainable support needs to focus on pools that are neither strongest nor weakest. The following delegation distribution was defined:\n\n* 50% of our dedicated stake to the geographically distributed pools \n* 25% to socially active pools with solid technical potential\n* 25% to the lower-middle sized pools to even out the network balance\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the factors that influenced our choice to understand the reasoning behind it.\n\n**Geographical distribution**\n\nCardano is a decentralized, distributed network of nodes that work together to verify block production and transaction validity in the network. Decentralization is key to this process as only independence from governing entities establishes trust and confidence in handling financial activities. To ensure that the network is resilient to connectivity failures, it is essential that stake pool operation nodes are distributed across the globe without significant concentration in one location. This is beneficial for setting up connections between different regions and eliminates a single point of failure. A minimum of two relays was another factor in play as part of this.\n\n**Social/community activity**\n\nOur survey earlier in the year helped us understand that a critical issue SPOs face is the inability to differentiate. For this reason, we used a social impact score from [Pulsar](https://www.pulsarplatform.com/) to help us understand which stake pools were gaining traction across potential delegators. \n\nAs well as \u2018ambassadors\u2019 for the network, we have evaluated socially active stake pools that operate to support business goals in their countries or for the betterment of various community activities. We have chosen those pools that have great social presence and community engagement but face difficulties in gaining a stronger position in terms of reward predictability. To be clear, technical performance is still the most important factor \u2013 no amount of tweets or Reddit posts is going to make up for missed blocks.\n\n**Network balance**\n\nWith such a variety of stake pools all functioning for different purposes, we are also distinguishing potentially strong pools that have been working hard to keep the network activities and support block production and transaction validation. Delegating to these pools, we support smaller-middle size businesses and help their delegators earn stable rewards. \n\nDue to the security properties of the Ouroboros protocol, the selection process for block production is ultimately randomized, and the probability of creating a block is proportional to the amount of delegated stake.\n\nSuch a condition is well-applicable for long-term reward behavior, however, in terms of shorter timespans (one or several epochs), this randomness can yield an unpredictable amount of rewards. This effect increases the smaller amount of delegation the pool has, which in turn might have an undesired side effect disconcerting delegators who expect a predictable amount of return on their stake.\n\n## Meeting the winners\n\nHere\u2019s a list of 100 stake pools chosen for our new round of delegation. If you\u2019re interested to find out more about these pools and their mission, you can easily do so at [adafolio.com](https://adafolio.com/portfolio/c5df0868-b4cf-11eb-8c63-0242c0a86003) or [adapools.org](https://adapools.org/delegations/input-output). \n\n![delegation winners](https://ucarecdn.com/866682b7-e4df-4a94-ae50-ea78468ee214/ \"delegation winners\")\n\nWe are aiming to delegate to these pools at the end of May/early June, so SPOs can expect to receive ada from then for a period of three months. \n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAs much as we are happy to recognize 100 stake pools that we believe have solid potential in reaching business objectives and supporting ecosystem sustainability, we still understand that there are many more contributors that we are not able to delegate to this time. We would like to thank you for all you do and if you were not selected this time, please note that we\u2019ll have a new delegation round three months from now. \n\nSo, we encourage all pools that missed out to apply again for the fresh cohort during Q3, and we\u2019ll make a new call for applications in June to rotate delegations in July. While technical analysis is the primary way that pools are identified for delegation, we always welcome community feedback on how we can continue to improve the process. We are committed to seeing the Cardano ecosystem go from strength to strength. Together we have created the world\u2019s leading proof-of-stake ecosystem and we want to do what we can to maintain and improve it as it matures.\n\n*Thanks to Ben O\u2019Hanlon, Colin Edwards, Francisco Landino, Sam Leathers, Olga Hryniuk & Tim Harrison for support and additional contributions.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "announcing-new-stake-pools-chosen-for-our-delegation-strategy", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/05/14/announcing-new-stake-pools-chosen-for-our-delegation-strategy/", "read_time": 9}], "recentPosts": [{"publish_date": "2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z", "author": {"title": "Niamh Ahern", "display_name": "Niamh Ahern", "thumbnail": "https://ucarecdn.com/8ac49795-0145-4168-8d90-d667340a7ac8/", "is_team_member": true, "is_active": true, "localized": [{"job_titles": [{"name": "Technical Writer", "primary": null}, {"name": "Education", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "niamh.ahern@iohk.io", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/niamh-ahern-67849949/", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/nahern_iohk?lang=en", "github": "https://github.com/nahern"}}], "job_titles": [{"name": "Technical Writer", "primary": null}, {"name": "Education", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "niamh.ahern@iohk.io", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/niamh-ahern-67849949/", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/nahern_iohk?lang=en", "github": "https://github.com/nahern"}, "profile_url": "/blog/authors/niamh-ahern/", "blog_posts": [{"publish_date": "2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/350386c8-b07f-44f0-9787-0c898a3d0460/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways.

They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways.

Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "a-close-look-at-the-software-running-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/06/08/a-close-look-at-the-software-running-cardano/", "read_time": 5}, {"publish_date": "2021-04-30T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/65cf3157-04f6-4e3c-9c8e-4ef6f51dc047/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "The essential Cardano list - a new resource for the community", "subtitle": "Introducing a new central source for all things Cardano-related", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Today sees the publication of [the Essential Cardano list](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano) \u2013 a new GitHub repository which will help you to find out everything you need to know about Cardano.

This week we have contacted everyone interested (over 2,000) to get a better idea of their experience and expertise. Those of you who have been selected for the first round of this program will hear from us very soon.

The cohort joining this program will be true pioneers. As well as being part of a group that will have *early access* to a set of learning modules, your feedback will help us develop and iterate the overall learning experience.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe course will teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus.

We will also be holding regular Q&A sessions and you will have access to a dedicated community channel on Discord, created especially to help you to connect with other course participants as you learn. \r\n\r\nOutside the exercises and videos, students will be encouraged to learn at a pace that is right for them and to collaborate with fellow students. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week. These moderators are all graduates of the [Mongolia class of 2020](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/21/online-learning-with-haskell-the-mongolia-class-of-2020/) that completed the Haskell MOOC and are well placed to assist with questions and challenges. At the close of each week, Lars will engage directly with the group to resolve more complex technical questions and provide feedback on the subject matter covered that week. \r\n\r\n## Prior experience ##\r\nAs Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language), will be very helpful. At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts. We are also developing education programs for both [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/marlowe/marlowe-explainer.html) and [Glow](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), so don't feel like you have missed out if this Plutus course is not for you. We\u2019re still keen to have you onboard, so do watch this space for details of these other courses!\r\n\r\n## Certification ##\r\nWe will reward participants for their efforts in participating in this course and certify those pioneers that complete the entire program and are successful. These Plutus pioneer certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their knowledge and qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.\r\n \r\n## Ready to start ##\r\nWe are excited to have so many developers from our ecosystem on board and ready to get started and learn Plutus. You\u2019ll not only be learning yourselves, but acting as a pioneer to help us determine the best way to teach and deliver this course \u2013 truly helping pave the way for future cohorts who enroll!

IOHK has relaunched the Mantis project to mitigate against the recent attacks, provide enhanced security, and establish a robust means of interacting with the ETC chain. A commitment to fostering innovation and sustainability lies at the heart of the project. We are aiming to provide a steady funding income with the establishment of a proto-treasury to nurture future development and growth. This Mantis re-launch represents the culmination of a project that we've been working on for some time. Over the past few months, we have resurrected our code base, and gathered a dedicated Mantis team together who have worked hard to refine and improve the code and deliver important new features.\n\n## What\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Mantis\u00a0project?\n\nMantis is a project that is built for the community, specifically designed for the developers, wallet users, and infrastructure providers to enable direct interaction with the ETC blockchain. Essentially, it is a place where future development can evolve and be tested by the community. The Mantis release includes the following components:\n- Mantis client - a CLI tool that connects to other clients in a peer-to-peer manner to allow users to communicate with the ETC chain, send and receive transactions, sync the blockchain data, execute and validate smart contracts, and deploy new smart contracts on-chain.\r\n- Mantis wallet - a node wallet with incorporated graphical user interface (GUI), which connects to both mainnet and the Sagano and Mordor testnets. \r\n- Mantis faucet - enables developers to receive testnet funds for use on the Sagano and Mordor testnets.\r\n- Mantis explorer - allows tracking recent activities and transactions in regards to the ETC chain, covering the ETC mainnet, and Sagano and Mordor testnets. \n\nPlease visit the [Mantis website](https://mantisclient.io/) where you can download the latest version of both the Mantis client and wallet.\r\n\r\nMantis software implements the official Ethereum Classic specification and Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals [(ECIPs)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) introduced by ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem. The project has undergone a number of enhancements in terms of adding robustness and variety to the client offering, including optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term. It has been developed from the ground up and built in 100% Scala code, a functional programming language that offers security guarantees that other languages do not. Mantis features include stable peer discovery, pruning, fast synchronization, and newly implemented checkpointing (for 51% attack resistance) and proto-treasury (for long-term sustainability). Let\u2019s take a closer look at these features.\n\n## Checkpointing \r\n*Persistence* and *liveness* are two crucial properties that a transaction ledger should possess. It is a proven fact that both persistence and liveness suffer when the adversarial mining power in the proof of work surpasses 50%, and in the recent year, ETC has undergone several double-spending attacks prompted by the creation of large chain reorganizations. Considering that persistence and liveness were not guaranteed within the ETC network, we sought to implement protocol changes that will re-establish persistence and liveness under current network conditions, and *checkpointing* is one of the proposed solutions. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered, by using the *k* parameter, or depth parameter, where every *k* block gets irreversibly \"checkpointed\", meaning that no one can ever drop or revert it. A trusted authority can choose the block on which to issue a checkpoint, which means that they can decide which block becomes the canonical chain that all parties should follow. This trusted authority must run continuously and is responsible for publishing the checkpoint to the network. Checkpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered with regards to mining. The mining rewards are not affected and the checkpointing federation can only issue checkpoints on blocks that have valid proof of work and cannot mint blocks on its own. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing is now implemented within the Mantis project, and according to our recent [ECIP comparison for 51% attack resistance](https://static.iohk.io/docs/etc/ecip-comparison-for-51-attack-resistance.pdf), it provides far greater, and importantly formally proven, security against these types of attacks. It is important that any 51% attack mitigation is truly robust enough to give absolute certainty to ETC holders, users, and service providers that their transactions will be secure.\r\n\n## Proto-Treasury\r\nFor the longer-term health and success of the ETC ecosystem, we position network growth, sustainability, and innovation as key elements to ensure network security. With that in mind, we are implementing a proto-treasury system within the Mantis project to establish a steady funding income.  A well-developed governance strategy will enable effective, distributed funding for the long-term development of Mantis, whereas a decentralized treasury would ensure two important things for the future of the ecosystem:\r\n- Firstly, it would provide a permanent ongoing source of funding for the ETC network. while increasing the value of the ecosystem and promoting greater developer engagement. \r\n\r\n- Secondly, it would provide a distributed and transparent funding mechanism, which lets the ETC community determine its future growth and enable the sustainability required for innovation and growth.\r\n\r\nEstablishing the treasury for funding purposes ensures a clear vision of the substantial system maintenance focused to obtain innovation and diversity from other projects, including proof of stake (PoS) and newer blockchains. This solution is straightforward in its optimization for speed and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal foresees to distribute 80% of existing mining rewards to miners and 20% to the proto-treasury smart contract. The treasury will be controlled by the community and will enable a decentralized, collaborative decision-making process, offering an opt-in type collaboration for those who are interested.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\r\nAs much as we\u2019re excited about the Mantis relaunch, it should be stressed that its capability won\u2019t be limited to just the features outlined here. Mantis is an evolving project and right now we are establishing its foundational building blocks and running rigorous security audits. Further down the road, it will see more performance improvements in terms of CPU, GPU and ASICs compatibility, a new proof-of-work consensus protocol and algorithm introduction (PRISM consensus, Keccak256 algorithm) and, of course, additional enhancements for better interoperability and speed of transaction processing.

Our mission is to grow our global community and business through the medium of education, and to share what we have learned. By claiming leadership in worldwide education on blockchain technology, we have the chance to shape the field for generations and to leave a lasting legacy.\n\nA consistent theme from 2019 has been the demand for a broad range of educational content, as demonstrated by the feedback received about the Incentivized Testnet, as well as the steady flow of support requests to our helpdesk. A key focus in IOHK for 2020 is to develop and expand our education materials as we transition fully into the Shelley era and then to the Goguen era of Cardano.\n\nThe IOHK education team will be investing significant time and effort this year in broadening our range of materials. We aim to enhance understanding of our technologies using a variety of learning and training assets targeted at a wide range of stakeholder audiences, both internal and external. This will be vital as the use of IOHK technology moves into the mainstream. We also aim to provide knowledge and information to enterprise decision-makers so they know what business problems our technologies can solve. We have lots planned and many projects are underway as we grow Cardano into a global social and financial operating system.\n\n## What can you expect?\n\nWe started 2020 with lectures, by Dr Lars Br\u00fcnjes, our director of education, at the University of Malta. The focus of these lectures was on Plutus and Marlowe, our programming languages for smart contracts. The fruits of these sessions will, in turn, form the foundation of some modular training materials that we plan to formalize and develop over the coming months.\n\nOur free Udemy courses on [Plutus](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/) and [Marlowe](https://www.udemy.com/course/marlowe-programming-language/) by Alejandro Garcia have proven very popular, with over 5,000 students signed up. Feedback has been positive and, as a result of what we learned from our students, we\u2019ve been making incremental improvements over the last year. We now want to take this to the next level and are planning to fully update both courses soon to bring them up to speed with the latest development changes and new features. We are also in the initial planning stages for a second edition of the ebook, [Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts](https://leanpub.com/plutus-smart-contracts) by Lars Br\u00fcnjes and Polina Vinogradova, which we will be publishing later this year. The writing team has started to identify improvements and we are also gathering feedback directly from readers. If you have suggestions, please raise a pull request in our [Plutus ebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-book) with your ideas.\n\nAn important step in bridging the gap between our academic papers and mainstream understanding of these concepts is to teach people about Ouroboros, the proof-of-stake protocol that powers Cardano and ada. In response to the valuable feedback we have received from running the Incentivized Testnet, we are planning to create varied educational content to help stake pool operators understand Ouroboros and how the protocol works on a practical level.\n\n## Broadening our reach\n\nTo broaden the reach of our training courses and content, we are also investigating a way to migrate our popular Haskell training course into a massive online course, or MOOC, while also making it more comprehensive with the inclusion of Plutus and Marlowe material. In this way, we hope our MOOC will make the course even more valuable, and provide access to the widest possible global community. In addition, we are planning a comprehensive classroom-based Haskell and Plutus course in Mongolia, details of which will be finalized soon. We plan to use the introductory part of the online Haskell course as a primer for this face-to-face training. This is an example of a core efficiency that we are embracing where we aim to reuse content on Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe across a variety of stand-alone modular materials that we can use externally and within the company for developing our staff.\n\nWe appreciate the value of interactive and meaningful training workshops, so we intend to host many more this year in several locations around the world. These events are in the initial planning stages and the first in the series will take place in Quebec in the spring. We\u2019ll announce more details through our official channels \u2013 Twitter, email, here \u2013 nearer the time. The IOHK education team are on hand to support and prepare the necessary learning tools for participants to use at these events.\n\nAlongside these materials and courses, we are mentoring an undergraduate student at the International University of Management (ISM), with her thesis on the topic of the power of blockchain in emerging markets. Additionally, Dr Jamie Gabbay has been invited to contribute to the book '*Applications of new generation technology to cryptocurrencies, banking, and finance*\u2019 by Devraj Basu.\n\n## Internal initiatives\n\nWe are also working with our human resources team to build the IOHK Training Academy: a new learning portal for our internal teams to upskill and develop professionally. This new resource is part of our learning and development strategy that aims to improve employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We want to provide access to a library of assets so our staff can easily find exactly what they need. We will be developing tailored \u2018learning journeys\u2019 by function, ready-made content that will help people develop skills in new areas, as well as creating specific onboarding journeys for new starters. This is a vital resource for a fast-growing company with staff and contractors spread across 43 countries and will prove to be an important asset for all our people.\n\n2020 is going to be a pivotal year for Cardano and we are looking forward to playing our part. It is our aim to teach both individuals and organizations how to use the protocol, and how it can help with their everyday lives.

These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways. These components form the Cardano \u2018platform stack\u2019. They work together under the hood to support the construction and use of the live Cardano blockchain.\n\nWe are currently in the early testnet phase on the way to the Alonzo hard fork, which will bring full smart contract capability to Cardano. This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet.

This week we have contacted everyone interested (over 2,000) to get a better idea of their experience and expertise. Those of you who have been selected for the first round of this program will hear from us very soon. If you don\u2019t receive an invitation at this stage, don\u2019t worry as we will be running several rounds of this program, so please do stay in touch!\n\n\r\n\r\n## Course structure ##\r\nThe first iteration of the new program starts next week.  The cohort joining this program will be true pioneers. As well as being part of a group that will have *early access* to a set of learning modules, your feedback will help us develop and iterate the overall learning experience.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe course will teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus. The course modules will cover the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including functions and data types, type classes, monads, template Haskell, using the [Plutus Playground](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/01/25/introducing-the-new-plutus-playground/), the [Extended UTXO model](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/), working with Plutus on and off the chain, minting policies, state machines, the Plutus application framework, as well as some case studies and practical exercises. \n\r\n\r\nThe course will follow a modular approach and will be highly interactive \u2013 each week we will be releasing new teaching videos from our director of education, Lars Br\u00fcnjes, along with a set of practical exercises to complete during the week as part of each module. We will also be holding regular Q&A sessions and you will have access to a dedicated community channel on Discord, created especially to help you to connect with other course participants as you learn. \r\n\r\nOutside the exercises and videos, students will be encouraged to learn at a pace that is right for them and to collaborate with fellow students. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week. These moderators are all graduates of the [Mongolia class of 2020](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/21/online-learning-with-haskell-the-mongolia-class-of-2020/) that completed the Haskell MOOC and are well placed to assist with questions and challenges. At the close of each week, Lars will engage directly with the group to resolve more complex technical questions and provide feedback on the subject matter covered that week. \r\n\r\n## Prior experience ##\r\nAs Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language), will be very helpful. At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts. We are also developing education programs for both [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/marlowe/marlowe-explainer.html) and [Glow](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), so don't feel like you have missed out if this Plutus course is not for you. We\u2019re still keen to have you onboard, so do watch this space for details of these other courses!\r\n\r\n## Certification ##\r\nWe will reward participants for their efforts in participating in this course and certify those pioneers that complete the entire program and are successful. These Plutus pioneer certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their knowledge and qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.\r\n \r\n## Ready to start ##\r\nWe are excited to have so many developers from our ecosystem on board and ready to get started and learn Plutus. You\u2019ll not only be learning yourselves, but acting as a pioneer to help us determine the best way to teach and deliver this course \u2013 truly helping pave the way for future cohorts who enroll!

As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out! We encourage all participants to *engage with each other* and work collaboratively to answer questions and solve problems. \r\n\r\nWe will have a small team of moderators who will check in from time to time to help facilitate and assist.  They can also  help triage issues or questions that may come up in your learning during the week. These moderators are all graduates of the [Mongolia class of 2020](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/21/online-learning-with-haskell-the-mongolia-class-of-2020/) that completed the Haskell MOOC and are well placed to assist with questions and challenges. At the close of each week, Lars will engage directly with the group to resolve more complex technical questions and provide feedback on the subject matter covered that week. \r\n\r\n## Prior experience ##\r\nAs Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language), will be very helpful. At a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset. You should be as keen to learn as to help us; while we have run a number of successful courses already, this is the first time we have challenged ourselves to teach at this scale. So be prepared for road bumps along the way as we learn and improve, too!\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. The course will include advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. If you need a refresher or get an introduction to Haskell, we recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before you participate in the course. We\u2019ll open several new cohorts this year, so you won\u2019t miss out.\r\n\r\n## When does the course start? ##\r\nThe course starts next week and will run concurrently for ten weeks through to mid June. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort each week. \r\n\r\n## Will there be other pioneer programs? ##\r\nYes, we are keen to be as inclusive as we can on our path to rolling out smart contracts. We are also developing education programs for both [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/marlowe/marlowe-explainer.html) and [Glow](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), so don't feel like you have missed out if this Plutus course is not for you. We\u2019re still keen to have you onboard, so do watch this space for details of these other courses!\r\n\r\n## Certification ##\r\nWe will reward participants for their efforts in participating in this course and certify those pioneers that complete the entire program and are successful. These Plutus pioneer certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their knowledge and qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.\r\n \r\n## Ready to start ##\r\nWe are excited to have so many developers from our ecosystem on board and ready to get started and learn Plutus. You\u2019ll not only be learning yourselves, but acting as a pioneer to help us determine the best way to teach and deliver this course \u2013 truly helping pave the way for future cohorts who enroll! We look forward to bringing you on this learning journey before we launch Plutus to the world!

IOHK has relaunched the Mantis project to mitigate against the recent attacks, provide enhanced security, and establish a robust means of interacting with the ETC chain. A commitment to fostering innovation and sustainability lies at the heart of the project. We are aiming to provide a steady funding income with the establishment of a proto-treasury to nurture future development and growth. This Mantis re-launch represents the culmination of a project that we've been working on for some time. Over the past few months, we have resurrected our code base, and gathered a dedicated Mantis team together who have worked hard to refine and improve the code and deliver important new features.\n\n## What\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Mantis\u00a0project?\n\nMantis is a project that is built for the community, specifically designed for the developers, wallet users, and infrastructure providers to enable direct interaction with the ETC blockchain. Essentially, it is a place where future development can evolve and be tested by the community. The Mantis release includes the following components:\n- Mantis client - a CLI tool that connects to other clients in a peer-to-peer manner to allow users to communicate with the ETC chain, send and receive transactions, sync the blockchain data, execute and validate smart contracts, and deploy new smart contracts on-chain.\r\n- Mantis wallet - a node wallet with incorporated graphical user interface (GUI), which connects to both mainnet and the Sagano and Mordor testnets. \r\n- Mantis faucet - enables developers to receive testnet funds for use on the Sagano and Mordor testnets.\r\n- Mantis explorer - allows tracking recent activities and transactions in regards to the ETC chain, covering the ETC mainnet, and Sagano and Mordor testnets. \n\nPlease visit the [Mantis website](https://mantisclient.io/) where you can download the latest version of both the Mantis client and wallet.\r\n\r\nMantis software implements the official Ethereum Classic specification and Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals [(ECIPs)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) introduced by ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem. The project has undergone a number of enhancements in terms of adding robustness and variety to the client offering, including optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term. It has been developed from the ground up and built in 100% Scala code, a functional programming language that offers security guarantees that other languages do not. Mantis features include stable peer discovery, pruning, fast synchronization, and newly implemented checkpointing (for 51% attack resistance) and proto-treasury (for long-term sustainability). Let\u2019s take a closer look at these features.\n\n## Checkpointing \r\n*Persistence* and *liveness* are two crucial properties that a transaction ledger should possess. It is a proven fact that both persistence and liveness suffer when the adversarial mining power in the proof of work surpasses 50%, and in the recent year, ETC has undergone several double-spending attacks prompted by the creation of large chain reorganizations. Considering that persistence and liveness were not guaranteed within the ETC network, we sought to implement protocol changes that will re-establish persistence and liveness under current network conditions, and *checkpointing* is one of the proposed solutions. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered, by using the *k* parameter, or depth parameter, where every *k* block gets irreversibly \"checkpointed\", meaning that no one can ever drop or revert it. A trusted authority can choose the block on which to issue a checkpoint, which means that they can decide which block becomes the canonical chain that all parties should follow. This trusted authority must run continuously and is responsible for publishing the checkpoint to the network. Checkpointing ensures that the protocol is unaltered with regards to mining. The mining rewards are not affected and the checkpointing federation can only issue checkpoints on blocks that have valid proof of work and cannot mint blocks on its own. \r\n\r\nCheckpointing is now implemented within the Mantis project, and according to our recent [ECIP comparison for 51% attack resistance](https://static.iohk.io/docs/etc/ecip-comparison-for-51-attack-resistance.pdf), it provides far greater, and importantly formally proven, security against these types of attacks. It is important that any 51% attack mitigation is truly robust enough to give absolute certainty to ETC holders, users, and service providers that their transactions will be secure.\r\n\n## Proto-Treasury\r\nFor the longer-term health and success of the ETC ecosystem, we position network growth, sustainability, and innovation as key elements to ensure network security. With that in mind, we are implementing a proto-treasury system within the Mantis project to establish a steady funding income.  A well-developed governance strategy will enable effective, distributed funding for the long-term development of Mantis, whereas a decentralized treasury would ensure two important things for the future of the ecosystem:\r\n- Firstly, it would provide a permanent ongoing source of funding for the ETC network. while increasing the value of the ecosystem and promoting greater developer engagement. \r\n\r\n- Secondly, it would provide a distributed and transparent funding mechanism, which lets the ETC community determine its future growth and enable the sustainability required for innovation and growth.\r\n\r\nEstablishing the treasury for funding purposes ensures a clear vision of the substantial system maintenance focused to obtain innovation and diversity from other projects, including proof of stake (PoS) and newer blockchains. This solution is straightforward in its optimization for speed and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal foresees to distribute 80% of existing mining rewards to miners and 20% to the proto-treasury smart contract. The treasury will be controlled by the community and will enable a decentralized, collaborative decision-making process, offering an opt-in type collaboration for those who are interested.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\r\nAs much as we\u2019re excited about the Mantis relaunch, it should be stressed that its capability won\u2019t be limited to just the features outlined here. Mantis is an evolving project and right now we are establishing its foundational building blocks and running rigorous security audits. Further down the road, it will see more performance improvements in terms of CPU, GPU and ASICs compatibility, a new proof-of-work consensus protocol and algorithm introduction (PRISM consensus, Keccak256 algorithm) and, of course, additional enhancements for better interoperability and speed of transaction processing.

A key focus in IOHK for 2020 is to develop and expand our education materials as we transition fully into the Shelley era and then to the Goguen era of Cardano.\n\nThe IOHK education team will be investing significant time and effort this year in broadening our range of materials. We aim to enhance understanding of our technologies using a variety of learning and training assets targeted at a wide range of stakeholder audiences, both internal and external. This will be vital as the use of IOHK technology moves into the mainstream. We also aim to provide knowledge and information to enterprise decision-makers so they know what business problems our technologies can solve. We have lots planned and many projects are underway as we grow Cardano into a global social and financial operating system.\n\n## What can you expect?\n\nWe started 2020 with lectures, by Dr Lars Br\u00fcnjes, our director of education, at the University of Malta. The focus of these lectures was on Plutus and Marlowe, our programming languages for smart contracts. The fruits of these sessions will, in turn, form the foundation of some modular training materials that we plan to formalize and develop over the coming months.\n\nOur free Udemy courses on [Plutus](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/) and [Marlowe](https://www.udemy.com/course/marlowe-programming-language/) by Alejandro Garcia have proven very popular, with over 5,000 students signed up. Feedback has been positive and, as a result of what we learned from our students, we\u2019ve been making incremental improvements over the last year. We now want to take this to the next level and are planning to fully update both courses soon to bring them up to speed with the latest development changes and new features. We are also in the initial planning stages for a second edition of the ebook, [Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts](https://leanpub.com/plutus-smart-contracts) by Lars Br\u00fcnjes and Polina Vinogradova, which we will be publishing later this year. The writing team has started to identify improvements and we are also gathering feedback directly from readers. If you have suggestions, please raise a pull request in our [Plutus ebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-book) with your ideas.\n\nAn important step in bridging the gap between our academic papers and mainstream understanding of these concepts is to teach people about Ouroboros, the proof-of-stake protocol that powers Cardano and ada. In response to the valuable feedback we have received from running the Incentivized Testnet, we are planning to create varied educational content to help stake pool operators understand Ouroboros and how the protocol works on a practical level.\n\n## Broadening our reach\n\nTo broaden the reach of our training courses and content, we are also investigating a way to migrate our popular Haskell training course into a massive online course, or MOOC, while also making it more comprehensive with the inclusion of Plutus and Marlowe material. In this way, we hope our MOOC will make the course even more valuable, and provide access to the widest possible global community. In addition, we are planning a comprehensive classroom-based Haskell and Plutus course in Mongolia, details of which will be finalized soon. We plan to use the introductory part of the online Haskell course as a primer for this face-to-face training. This is an example of a core efficiency that we are embracing where we aim to reuse content on Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe across a variety of stand-alone modular materials that we can use externally and within the company for developing our staff.\n\nWe appreciate the value of interactive and meaningful training workshops, so we intend to host many more this year in several locations around the world. These events are in the initial planning stages and the first in the series will take place in Quebec in the spring. We\u2019ll announce more details through our official channels \u2013 Twitter, email, here \u2013 nearer the time. The IOHK education team are on hand to support and prepare the necessary learning tools for participants to use at these events.\n\nAlongside these materials and courses, we are mentoring an undergraduate student at the International University of Management (ISM), with her thesis on the topic of the power of blockchain in emerging markets. Additionally, Dr Jamie Gabbay has been invited to contribute to the book '*Applications of new generation technology to cryptocurrencies, banking, and finance*\u2019 by Devraj Basu.\n\n## Internal initiatives\n\nWe are also working with our human resources team to build the IOHK Training Academy: a new learning portal for our internal teams to upskill and develop professionally. This new resource is part of our learning and development strategy that aims to improve employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We want to provide access to a library of assets so our staff can easily find exactly what they need. We will be developing tailored \u2018learning journeys\u2019 by function, ready-made content that will help people develop skills in new areas, as well as creating specific onboarding journeys for new starters. This is a vital resource for a fast-growing company with staff and contractors spread across 43 countries and will prove to be an important asset for all our people.\n\n2020 is going to be a pivotal year for Cardano and we are looking forward to playing our part. It is our aim to teach both individuals and organizations how to use the protocol, and how it can help with their everyday lives.

This process is highly complex, requiring the steady upgrade of the different elements which make up the Cardano platform, and their careful integration and testing. So, it is a good time to revisit these components, explain some of the terminology, and discover how they interact within the \u2018platform stack\u2019.\n\n## Elements of the Cardano platform stack\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/913ea221-dd67-4938-84be-3461f79b0baa/)\n\n**Figure 1. Components that communicate with the Cardano node**\n\nThe platform stack for Cardano includes these core components:\n\n* Cardano node (and associated processes)\n* Cardano wallet\n* Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n* DB Sync (synchronizes blockchain data with a relational database)\n* PostgreSQL database (which interacts with GraphQL, REST API, and Smash)\n* Smash server\n* Rosetta API (blockchain communication protocol)\n\nNote that the Daedalus wallet is not part of the core stack, but does communicate with the components (Figure 1). \n\n### The node and the networking layer\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the [Cardano node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node). This software runs on your computer and underpins the network, enabling everyone to participate in the decentralized blockchain. The node integrates the consensus, ledger, and networking sub-components, providing top-level configuration, API, CLI, logging, memory management, and monitoring capabilities that can be used by other Cardano components or by skilled users. Daedalus is a full-node wallet, so if you are running that on your local machine, you are effectively helping to run the network. \n\n*The networking layer*\n\nNext, we have the networking layer. This links each Cardano node into a distributed system that manages the blockchain and associated services. The network consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger, support transaction submission, and interact with user wallets and other services. The core of the network is built around the decentralized nodes \u2013 the stake pools \u2013 that collectively validate blocks, and add new blocks to the chain. They are supported by dedicated relay nodes that manage network connections and establish the structure of the network as a whole. The dedicated consumer nodes that are run by the Daedalus wallet and other services connect to this network to track and submit transactions on-chain.\n\nCardano nodes maintain connections with their peers. A set of mini-protocols enable communication between the nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as informing peers of the latest block, sharing blocks as needed, or sharing new transactions around the Cardano network. For connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. \n\n### Cardano wallet backend\n\nThe [Cardano wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) backend component supports the graphical user interface of the Daedalus wallet. It is used to send and receive ada. Behind the scenes, the wallet runs a full Cardano node. Unlike a light client wallet, it loads the entire shared ledger and validates all transactions, thus bolstering the security of the blockchain for everyone.\n\n### Wallet command line interface (CLI)\n\nThe wallet command line interface (CLI) supports interactions with the actual blockchain. More technically advanced users can use the CLI  to work with a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and performing other tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.\n\n### DB Sync\n\n[DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) is a component that follows the activities on the Cardano chain and stores blocks and transactions in PostgreSQL. As a \u2018middleware\u2019 component, it powers [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql). DB Sync stores blockchain data fetched from [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) in an intermediate database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration. It also provides a number of queries to fetch Cardano blockchain data from the PostgreSQL, and supports services such as the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en.html), a graphical user interface that reflects the blockchain data in a straightforward way. Cardano GraphQL is a cross-platform API for the GraphQL data query language. \n\n### Rosetta API\n\nThe Rosetta application programming interface provides a high-level interface that aims to make the integration process easier, faster, and more reliable so that you can build once and integrate your blockchain everywhere. We have created a unique [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta) implementation to simplify the process of integration with Cardano. This interface is particularly useful for exchanges, since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they use with other blockchains.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nWith [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) coming to Cardano soon, this means that [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/), the native smart contract language, and other smart contract development languages like [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/) for finance and [Glow](https://glow-lang.org/) for DApps will be integrated into the Cardano stack. IO Global\u2019s engineers will provide new and extended components to compile Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow scripts, submit them on-chain, and interact with them (Figure 2).\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/49d00118-da94-4dde-9be2-1a721c698a39/)\n\n**Figure 2. Plutus, Marlowe, Glow, Solidity, and IELE can all be used to write Cardano smart contracts**\n\nThe [Alonzo protocol upgrade](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) will build on recent token upgrades and is being deployed to the mainnet via several testnets. Our Plutus partners and Plutus Pioneers will help us to test Plutus Core and will be part of the user acceptance phase before mainnet deployment. At this point we will officially add the Plutus and Marlowe components, such as both interpreters, to Cardano\u2019s platform stack. \n\n*To keep up to date with the Alonzo rollout, please check our social channels and blog page.*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "A close look at the software running Cardano", "subtitle": "Learn about the \u2018stack\u2019 of components that interact to run the blockchain platform", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "Cardano has been designed in modules, with linked components that can be used in various ways.

Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

Cardano and the Nervos Network. Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the [Nervos website](https://www.nervos.org/) for more information on upcoming partnerships and research initiatives.*\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/06/02/nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano/", "read_time": 3}, {"publish_date": "2021-02-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/b32a85c3-d8e4-4756-8972-df0fe7be0062/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Bringing Glow to Cardano", "subtitle": " We just spun up a devnet to support Glow, the very latest language Cardano will support.

We caught up with Rideau (also known as Fare) to hear more about his vision for Glow and the Cardano journey so far. The following is a distillation of his thoughts from our previous interviews.*\n\n\n\n**We first introduced the community to GLOW and MuKn at the end of [last year](https://youtu.be/lj9SlvOIBgU?t=2902) when we announced our devnets approach \u2013\u00a0 but maybe you can remind us how you began working with IOHK?**\n\nI started as a researcher in formal methods for programming languages and distributed systems. But I wanted to build systems actually used by many, so I moved into the industry where I notably worked on proving the correctness of a centralized payment protocol and creating an airline reservation system. After a few years at Google and Bridgewater, I decided life wasn\u2019t worth working under dysfunctional hierarchies, so I started my own cryptocurrency companies. Charles invited me to speak at the IOHK Summit 2019, and I realized how much I like the Cardano community: we have a similar focus on building robust software for the long term. That is why I wanted to port my domain specific language Glow to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Tell us a bit why you started your company Mutual Knowledge Systems, or as you call it MuKn (Moon)?**\n\nOver three years ago, I was reviewing whitepapers. Most papers (about \u00be) had interesting techniques but made no economic sense. Most of the rest (about \u2155) made economic sense but had no technical content. Only the top few (about 5%) actually made sense both technically and economically. At some point, I realized I could do better, so I designed a scaling solution using lessons learned from working on Tezos. Arthur Breitman challenged me to use smart contracts instead of trying to modify his protocol. \n\nWhile trying to prove his challenge absurd, I instead found that he was right and I was wrong\u2014and I finally understood why and how to use smart contracts. I started a company around the resulting scaling solution, raised money, pivoted into building the scaling solution after the language capable of generating it from specification, fought with and fired my then-partner, became my own CEO, started a new company, and, after much struggle, finally found the right founding team. Together, we built Mutual Knowledge Systems around this new programming language, Glow\u2014designed to be much better than existing languages to write decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n**When you say \u2018better\u2019, what do you really mean?**\n\nWriting a DApp is the single hardest thing to do in the world. This is because you can\u2019t afford a mistake, or your users may lose significant funds. Furthermore, you are not confronting random situations, but active adversaries bent on attacking your code, who will contrive the very worst case scenarios to exploit for their profit. Yet, unlike the military, you can\u2019t hide your code or protect access to your networks: all the critical pieces are necessarily public. On top of that, extant programming tools are not designed for these constraints and even traditional formal methods lack essential concepts to express the issues at stake.\n\nThus, we decided to make new tools fit for the challenge. Our domain-specific language (DSL) drastically simplifies DApp development, by abstracting away all the common blockchain infrastructure, so you can focus on your problem domain (trading, derivatives, insurance, supply chain, etc.). Your DApps can be thousands of lines of code that your users can afford to audit, instead of millions of lines of code that require leaps of blind faith. And the programming model will enable developers, auditors and automated verification tools to reason at the level of abstraction of participants exchanging assets, rather than at that of packets of bytes shipped around the Internet.\n\n\n\n**What is it about Cardano and its community that appeals?**\n\nI started like everyone else, on Ethereum, because its ecosystem is already mature. However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s got great fundamentals.\n\n\n\n**Can you talk about how you hope Glow will change the DApp developer experience?**\n\nGlow is portable. Today it works on Cardano and Ethereum but in the future it will work with any blockchain that is sufficiently advanced to support smart contracts. That means that you can write your DApp once and it will run on whichever platform has the users and the liquidity you seek. You don\u2019t have to make a guess about where liquidity will be in the future then sink heavy investments to develop on a single chain that you bet your house on.\n\n\n\nWith Glow, developers can run their DApps on all blockchains. Glow will commoditize blockchains. Blockchains will then compete on technical and economic merits, not on user lock-in and inertia. And the value brought to users will increase.\n\n\n\n**What can the community expect from Glow?**\n\nWe have launched this early version of Glow on the Cardano EVM Devnet with a command-line interface. In many ways, it is not yet ready for use by end-users, but it can already demonstrate simple applications. Users can also see how they may write a 6 line application in Glow that would require hundreds of lines in a combination of Solidity and JavaScript. We have a roadmap over the next few months to add a lot of features: from ERC20 tokens (and, on Cardano, native tokens), to generalized state channels, to a web interface, to a more robust runtime, etc. Eventually, we want to become the development environment for all blockchain projects. And Glow is of course an open source software open to the community.\n\n**We\u2019re rolling out the integration with Glow with our EVM and devnet program, so what are some of the benefits of this?**\n\nThe Cardano EVM side-chain will enable arbitrary contracts to run on Cardano that use the mature EVM platform, without waiting for Plutus to deliver its promise, to achieve feature-parity, to be considered stable, etc. And Glow can run on this EVM side-chain and provide the simplicity, safety and portability in DApp development that were not available before.\n\n**What is the rollout process like and how can our community get involved if they want to?**\n\nGlow is still in development. There are some things that it can do already and some it can\u2019t do yet. We invite DApp developers to join the Glow community and use the language for what it can already do, and otherwise help us build the blockchain development environment of the future. You can build the missing features you need yourself, or contract MuKn to build them for you. Even if you can\u2019t code and have no budget, you can help write the documentation, or even just tell us where it isn\u2019t clear yet, or what features you need most so we know what to prioritize. Together, we can build great DApps that you just couldn\u2019t have achieved safely and within budget with previous tools.\n\n*If you\u2019re a developer, we encourage you to get involved with [Mutual Knowledge Systems and Glow](https://mukn.io/).

However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s got great fundamentals.\n\n\n\n**Can you talk about how you hope Glow will change the DApp developer experience?**\n\nGlow is portable. Today it works on Cardano and Ethereum but in the future it will work with any blockchain that is sufficiently advanced to support smart contracts. That means that you can write your DApp once and it will run on whichever platform has the users and the liquidity you seek. You don\u2019t have to make a guess about where liquidity will be in the future then sink heavy investments to develop on a single chain that you bet your house on.\n\n\n\nWith Glow, developers can run their DApps on all blockchains. Glow will commoditize blockchains. Blockchains will then compete on technical and economic merits, not on user lock-in and inertia. And the value brought to users will increase.\n\n\n\n**What can the community expect from Glow?**\n\nWe have launched this early version of Glow on the Cardano EVM Devnet with a command-line interface. In many ways, it is not yet ready for use by end-users, but it can already demonstrate simple applications. Users can also see how they may write a 6 line application in Glow that would require hundreds of lines in a combination of Solidity and JavaScript. We have a roadmap over the next few months to add a lot of features: from ERC20 tokens (and, on Cardano, native tokens), to generalized state channels, to a web interface, to a more robust runtime, etc. Eventually, we want to become the development environment for all blockchain projects. And Glow is of course an open source software open to the community.\n\n**We\u2019re rolling out the integration with Glow with our EVM and devnet program, so what are some of the benefits of this?**\n\nThe Cardano EVM side-chain will enable arbitrary contracts to run on Cardano that use the mature EVM platform, without waiting for Plutus to deliver its promise, to achieve feature-parity, to be considered stable, etc. And Glow can run on this EVM side-chain and provide the simplicity, safety and portability in DApp development that were not available before.\n\n**What is the rollout process like and how can our community get involved if they want to?**\n\nGlow is still in development. There are some things that it can do already and some it can\u2019t do yet. We invite DApp developers to join the Glow community and use the language for what it can already do, and otherwise help us build the blockchain development environment of the future. You can build the missing features you need yourself, or contract MuKn to build them for you. Even if you can\u2019t code and have no budget, you can help write the documentation, or even just tell us where it isn\u2019t clear yet, or what features you need most so we know what to prioritize. Together, we can build great DApps that you just couldn\u2019t have achieved safely and within budget with previous tools.\n\n*If you\u2019re a developer, we encourage you to get involved with [Mutual Knowledge Systems and Glow](https://mukn.io/).

In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Decentralizing social media: a conversation with Ben Goertzel and Charles Hoskinson", "subtitle": "The minds behind SingularityNET and Cardano come together to explore a vision of the future of decentralization, AI, and social media.", "audio": null, "soundcloud": null, "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\n*At the end of 2020, we announced our collaboration with SingularityNET, in an exclusive [fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3O5F_CCT8c) between Charles Hoskinson and SingularityNET founder & CEO, Ben Goertzel.*\u00a0\n\n*SingularityNET recently shared further information on the partnership when they announced their exciting [Phase Two initiative](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a),* [](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a) *which includes a shift from Ethereum to Cardano, to achieve new network functionalities and launching a Stream of New AGI-ADA Tokens.*\n\n*Last week, Charles and Ben sat down again together in a special [SingularityNET podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNWJGGc7ESI). In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms.

To encourage participation, IOHK is sponsoring a prize fund of ada worth $10,000 as well as ongoing support to bring the projects to fruition. Proposals will be judged by a panel of IOHK and UN employees. They will determine the winners based on an idea\u2019s technical prowess, scalability and social impact, as well as its financial and volunteer support. The winning ideas will be able to seek the advice of experts from both the UN and IOHK to ensure that they are implemented in the most impactful way.\n\nTo qualify for the scheme, entries must be open source and be created for use on the Cardano blockchain. Example code should be written in Marlowe, a domain specific language developed for financial contracts on Cardano. These do not need to be fully coded submissions. Instead they can be ideas which inspire anyone to get involved with blockchain technology and sustainable development. The proposal submission period opens on Saturday October 10th.

Every presentation, panel and guest speaker at this online event, has been chosen to represent the many faces of Cardano. From world-class foundational research to the latest advances in cryptographic development; from the passion and dedication of the wider community to some of the innovators who have created our world and are lighting the path to the future. The event is meant to honor the hard work and dedication of the Cardano community, developers and contributors, and the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe virtual summit, much like IOHK\u2019s 2019 Miami summit will include presentations from IOHK team members, special guest appearances by thought leaders and a keynote speech by IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson. We were proud to announce that our guest of honor is internet co-creator and lead internet evangelist for Google, Vint Cerf. As one of the lead architects of the internet Vint is uniquely positioned to give us insight into building world changing technology.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be joined by Caitlin Long of the Wyoming Blockchain Select Committee. The Wall Street professional turned crypto pioneer has been blazing the trail for adoption in the state of Wyoming. She will give us a look at the challenges and opportunities she has faced while pushing for wider adoption of decentralization. Our final special guest, Stephen Wolfram is the creator of the computational knowledge platform Wolfram Alpha and the CEO of Wolfram Research. Cardano shares his dedication to advancing technology through open source research and a commitment to academic excellence. Between each of these important discussions our colleagues at IOHK will take center stage.\n\n## Thought leadership\n\nIOHK\u2019s chief scientist, Aggelos Kiayias, and director of African operations John O\u2019Connor will talk about research and outreach in the Cardano Blockchain. Our panel entitled \u2018Haskell, then, now, and the future\u2019 will examine the impact the functional programming language has had and where it is heading. The virtual summit also serves as the launchpad for new advancements like \u2018Prism\u2019 our decentralized identity solution.

We will be discussing next steps for growing the Cardano community alongside oncoming blockchain regulations, governance, and opportunities. In combination, we hope the summit tracks will offer something for anyone interested in the future of Cardano, by the science and ideas that surround it, by the great minds making it all happen and by the incredible community that has brought us here and will take us forward.\n\nSessions will encompass the philosophical as well as the technical. Brian Behlendorf, the CEO of the Hyperledger Consortium will form part of a panel focused on the importance of open source development. IOHK recently [joined](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/11/why-we-are-joining-hyperledger/) the Hyperledger Consortium, to better exploit our common vision of a future made better through shared knowledge. Following on the philosophy track, artificial intelligence researcher, Ben Goertzel will speak on the intersection of AI and decentralized technology. We hope to announce more exciting sessions in the days leading up to the event. At the end of the day, building the next generation of technology means bringing the best minds of many fields into the same room, even if it\u2019s a virtual one.\n\n## Building community\n\nThe Cardano Virtual Summit 2020: Shelley Edition, won\u2019t be all work and no play. The Covid crisis has forced every conference online in past months. While we can\u2019t recreate the full physical conference experience in the virtual space, we\u2019re keen to provide some of the networking and downtime opportunities you might expect. So we\u2019ve added a virtual \u2018chill-out\u2019 zone, with guided meditations, a DJ set, and even an online calligraphy lesson/demonstration. Our virtual platform will allow attendees to enjoy the digital expo space through avatars. We\u2019ll even get the conversation flowing with a digital Shelley cocktail \u2018happy hour\u2019 between meetings.\n\nRecent events have made it difficult to meet in person but we see The Cardano Virtual Summit as an opportunity to invite everyone from around the world to participate. Attendance for anyone interested in the summit is absolutely free of charge. To join in, simply [reserve](https://www.ubivent.com/register/cardanovirtualsummit) your spot.\n\nShelley is the culmination of over 5 years of research and development, the creation of a multi-disciplinary team and a remarkable community. The virtual summit is just a single point of time \u2013 a time to take stock, reflect and celebrate.

Every presentation, panel and guest speaker at this online event, has been chosen to represent the many faces of Cardano. From world-class foundational research to the latest advances in cryptographic development; from the passion and dedication of the wider community to some of the innovators who have created our world and are lighting the path to the future. The event is meant to honor the hard work and dedication of the Cardano community, developers and contributors, and the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe virtual summit, much like IOHK\u2019s 2019 Miami summit will include presentations from IOHK team members, special guest appearances by thought leaders and a keynote speech by IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson. We were proud to announce that our guest of honor is internet co-creator and lead internet evangelist for Google, Vint Cerf. As one of the lead architects of the internet Vint is uniquely positioned to give us insight into building world changing technology.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be joined by Caitlin Long of the Wyoming Blockchain Select Committee. The Wall Street professional turned crypto pioneer has been blazing the trail for adoption in the state of Wyoming. She will give us a look at the challenges and opportunities she has faced while pushing for wider adoption of decentralization. Our final special guest, Stephen Wolfram is the creator of the computational knowledge platform Wolfram Alpha and the CEO of Wolfram Research. Cardano shares his dedication to advancing technology through open source research and a commitment to academic excellence.

He recently sat down for an interview to discuss the upcoming Byron reboot, the Haskell Shelley testnet, and the conclusion of the pre-Shelley development cycle. Coutts, who has been working with IOHK since 2016, brings a wealth of knowledge from working with the Haskell programming language for nearly 20 years and helping found the Well-Typed consultancy.\n\n**What\u2019s your role at IOHK?**\n\nI\u2019m the chief technical architect for the Cardano project and I\u2019m primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the node. This means that I collaborate with the teams that work on consensus, ledger, networking, and other things. Ultimately, I work to bring everyone together around the same design after a discussion with the team leaders. The design of Cardano is the product of joint work by many individuals working together.\n\n**What does the Haskell programming language bring to Cardano?**\n\nHaskell is an enabler. It makes it easier for us to follow the approach that we believe is right, which is driven by computer science. We know how to do things properly; computer science tells us how. We just need to pick the appropriate techniques to do that. Haskell makes that easier.\n\nIt\u2019s a good fit for Cardano because it suits the high-assurance, specification-driven software that is vital for a blockchain. Haskell helps us find systematic ways of avoiding mistakes. In essence, it\u2019s a better mousetrap.\n\n**You\u2019ve been working with Haskell for a long time. How have you seen the landscape of functional programming change?**\n\nPeople take it seriously now. When I started as an undergraduate in 1999, I thought that Haskell was amazing. Other students thought, \u2018Wow that\u2019s totally impractical. How will you ever get a job?\u2019\n\nAt the time, functional programming was an academic curiosity. There wasn\u2019t any prebuilt code and it wasn\u2019t machine readable, which meant that Haskell wasn\u2019t usable for a wide range of people. There wasn\u2019t the tooling, range of libraries, or experience. That has changed over the years: the tooling got better, the libraries got better. IOHK has helped develop the infrastructure for building and distributing open-source Haskell code and the number of libraries exploded. That, combined with more teaching and a gradual change of attitude in the industry, means that people take it more seriously now. Haskell hasn\u2019t changed as much as the industry around us has.\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest change from an industry point of view?**\n\nThere are two things. The first is that attitudes are changing, albeit slowly. People are changing their opinions about what they consider a sensible language choice. Previously, everything had to be in C or Java or maybe Python, but eventually good ideas make progress, even if it takes a long time. You can make a lot of progress by just recognizing that a good idea is a good idea. The mainstream does pick up on important developments, even if it does take 10 or 15 years. The industry has not embraced functional programming wholesale yet, but individual programmers have taken up various ideas. That makes Haskell look less radical.\n\nIf you look at a language like Rust, it has some of the clever type systems of Haskell, although it doesn\u2019t have any functional programming ideas. Even Java and C++ have some functional programming ideas in them these days, so Haskell is not quite so far from the mainstream as it used to be.\n\nThe second major change has been performance, which is getting much better. We\u2019ve recently become competitive with Java in terms of performance. It makes people say, \u2018Wow, Haskell is so fast,\u2019 but that\u2019s because they\u2019re comparing it to Python and PHP rather than C. So that\u2019s another way of saying that Haskell has improved slightly, but the industry environment around it has changed as well.\n\n**You have been heavily involved in the Byron reboot which was kicked off last week. Why was this work important?**\n\nThe [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/) is the culmination of over 18 months of hard work across multiple IOHK development teams, and constitutes a complete overhaul of the node infrastructure with 100% fresh code. The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself. The Byron reboot will go a long way to improving things, and users should see Daedalus syncing and restoring wallets within minutes, even when downloading the entire Cardano blockchain.\n\n**As the chief architect, your job is to lay the foundation for Cardano\u2019s future. What have you focused on to achieve this?**\n\nThe most important aspect in terms of flexibility for the future is keeping different functions separate. One of the big improvements of the Byron reboot is that the ledger rules will be totally independent of the consensus implementation; this modularity means that the ledger rules are perfectly clean mathematical functions, which is a core aspect of functional programming.\n\nAs a result, everything is easier to test, tweak, and change, both now and in the future. The consensus algorithm isn\u2019t entangled with the details of the ledger rules, so we can alter the ledger rules without changing the consensus implementation. This makes integrating Plutus and smart contracts functionality much easier and will also help in the future when we are adding treasury and governance features.\n\nThe consensus implementation itself has also been parameterized so that we can transition from the Ouroboros Classic consensus protocol to BFT and then Praos, which also provides flexibility for future versions of the protocol that haven't been developed yet.\n\n**Shelley is a big step towards the future of Cardano, but what is the significance of compiling Haskell into JavaScript and WebAssembly?**\n\nWe\u2019re interested in compiling to JavaScript or WebAssembly because of Plutus. We want to have Plutus contracts or Plutus applications that can be distributed to users, which would include custom interfaces and custom logic with the user rather than in a server. Compiling to JavaScript allows us to do that; you can compile the Plutus code once and distribute it to users on different platforms.\n\n- - -\n\nThanks to Duncan Coutts for his time. As chief technical architect, he\u2019s a cornerstone of the Cardano project and has been fundamental to the ongoing success of the platform.

The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself. The Byron reboot will go a long way to improving things, and users should see Daedalus syncing and restoring wallets within minutes, even when downloading the entire Cardano blockchain.\n\n**As the chief architect, your job is to lay the foundation for Cardano\u2019s future. What have you focused on to achieve this?**\n\nThe most important aspect in terms of flexibility for the future is keeping different functions separate. One of the big improvements of the Byron reboot is that the ledger rules will be totally independent of the consensus implementation; this modularity means that the ledger rules are perfectly clean mathematical functions, which is a core aspect of functional programming.\n\nAs a result, everything is easier to test, tweak, and change, both now and in the future. The consensus algorithm isn\u2019t entangled with the details of the ledger rules, so we can alter the ledger rules without changing the consensus implementation. This makes integrating Plutus and smart contracts functionality much easier and will also help in the future when we are adding treasury and governance features.\n\nThe consensus implementation itself has also been parameterized so that we can transition from the Ouroboros Classic consensus protocol to BFT and then Praos, which also provides flexibility for future versions of the protocol that haven't been developed yet.\n\n**Shelley is a big step towards the future of Cardano, but what is the significance of compiling Haskell into JavaScript and WebAssembly?**\n\nWe\u2019re interested in compiling to JavaScript or WebAssembly because of Plutus. We want to have Plutus contracts or Plutus applications that can be distributed to users, which would include custom interfaces and custom logic with the user rather than in a server. Compiling to JavaScript allows us to do that; you can compile the Plutus code once and distribute it to users on different platforms.\n\n- - -\n\nThanks to Duncan Coutts for his time. As chief technical architect, he\u2019s a cornerstone of the Cardano project and has been fundamental to the ongoing success of the platform.

The first answer to a problem is rarely the best, and any enterprise-focused solution cannot be gated by complexity or threaten network security.\n\n## Bringing functional programming to smart contracts with Plutus\n\nWe\u2019re big fans of functional programming here at IOHK and are proud to be able to say that the code underpinning the Cardano network is written in Haskell, the world\u2019s foremost functional programming language. Plutus is no different. Compared to their object-oriented counterparts, functional programming languages are less prone to ambiguity and human error \u2013 always a good thing \u2013 as well as being easier to verify and test. By using Plutus to write smart contracts on the Cardano network, developers benefit from all of the above, as well as the ability to use the same language for both on and off-chain code.\n\nWhile developers will have to wait for the Goguen era to launch smart contracts on the Cardano network, they can begin testing their smart contract skills in the [Plutus Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/plutus/tools/playground/ \"Plutus Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"). IOHK has also created a [Plutus ebook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plutus-Writing-reliable-smart-contracts-ebook/dp/B07V46LWTW \"Plutus ebook, amazon.com\") and [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/ \"Plutus Udemy course, udemy.com\") to help developers hit the ground running once Plutus is available on the Cardano mainnet.\n\n## And bringing Plutus to everyone with Marlowe\n\nThe problem with smart contracts, however, is that sometimes the people who know how to write the code don\u2019t have the industry expertise to know how to structure the contracts themselves. Enter Marlowe, IOHK\u2019s domain-specific language (DSL). Marlowe is designed for use by anyone that wants to write a financial smart contract without the programming skills to implement it. Users can try out Marlowe via the [Marlowe Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/marlowe/get-started/sample-marlowe-smart-contracts/ \"Marlowe Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"), a web utility with a user-friendly GUI and drag and drop components, where they can create financial smart contracts which, when complete, will generate fully-functional, implementation-ready Plutus code.\n\nMarlowe gives anyone the ability to gain familiarity with smart contracts while protecting them from unexpected outcomes. It also protects the developer and the system by ensuring that ill-formed smart contracts cannot be run. Finally, Marlowe focuses on commitment-of-funds and time-outs. These make certain that both parties have dedicated funds in the agreement while ensuring that money will not be left in the system after a contract has concluded.\n\n## Laying solid foundations\n\nPlutus, Marlowe, and the Cardano ecosystem continue to evolve to provide the safest and most efficient conditions to build decentralized applications. The next generations of Plutus and Marlowe will be announced at the WyoHackathon at the University of Wyoming on September 20, ahead of their release on mainnet at the start of the Goguen era. Marlowe advances include a high-fidelity development system that aids the writing of executable contracts and the new iteration of Plutus will allow users to access their contracts from web or mobile applications.

Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

This week, building on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://developers.cardano.org/en/virtual-machines/welcome/), we\u2019re rolling out a new [development environment](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/) to support the Glow language.*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau of Mutual Knowledge Systems is the creator of Glow, a DSL that will allow anyone to write verifiable DApps from a single spec and deploy it on our EVM network. We caught up with Rideau (also known as Fare) to hear more about his vision for Glow and the Cardano journey so far. The following is a distillation of his thoughts from our previous interviews.*\n\n\n\n**We first introduced the community to GLOW and MuKn at the end of [last year](https://youtu.be/lj9SlvOIBgU?t=2902) when we announced our devnets approach \u2013\u00a0 but maybe you can remind us how you began working with IOHK?**\n\nI started as a researcher in formal methods for programming languages and distributed systems. But I wanted to build systems actually used by many, so I moved into the industry where I notably worked on proving the correctness of a centralized payment protocol and creating an airline reservation system. After a few years at Google and Bridgewater, I decided life wasn\u2019t worth working under dysfunctional hierarchies, so I started my own cryptocurrency companies. Charles invited me to speak at the IOHK Summit 2019, and I realized how much I like the Cardano community: we have a similar focus on building robust software for the long term. That is why I wanted to port my domain specific language Glow to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Tell us a bit why you started your company Mutual Knowledge Systems, or as you call it MuKn (Moon)?**\n\nOver three years ago, I was reviewing whitepapers. Most papers (about \u00be) had interesting techniques but made no economic sense. Most of the rest (about \u2155) made economic sense but had no technical content. Only the top few (about 5%) actually made sense both technically and economically. At some point, I realized I could do better, so I designed a scaling solution using lessons learned from working on Tezos. Arthur Breitman challenged me to use smart contracts instead of trying to modify his protocol. \n\nWhile trying to prove his challenge absurd, I instead found that he was right and I was wrong\u2014and I finally understood why and how to use smart contracts. I started a company around the resulting scaling solution, raised money, pivoted into building the scaling solution after the language capable of generating it from specification, fought with and fired my then-partner, became my own CEO, started a new company, and, after much struggle, finally found the right founding team. Together, we built Mutual Knowledge Systems around this new programming language, Glow\u2014designed to be much better than existing languages to write decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n**When you say \u2018better\u2019, what do you really mean?**\n\nWriting a DApp is the single hardest thing to do in the world. This is because you can\u2019t afford a mistake, or your users may lose significant funds. Furthermore, you are not confronting random situations, but active adversaries bent on attacking your code, who will contrive the very worst case scenarios to exploit for their profit. Yet, unlike the military, you can\u2019t hide your code or protect access to your networks: all the critical pieces are necessarily public. On top of that, extant programming tools are not designed for these constraints and even traditional formal methods lack essential concepts to express the issues at stake.\n\nThus, we decided to make new tools fit for the challenge. Our domain-specific language (DSL) drastically simplifies DApp development, by abstracting away all the common blockchain infrastructure, so you can focus on your problem domain (trading, derivatives, insurance, supply chain, etc.). Your DApps can be thousands of lines of code that your users can afford to audit, instead of millions of lines of code that require leaps of blind faith. And the programming model will enable developers, auditors and automated verification tools to reason at the level of abstraction of participants exchanging assets, rather than at that of packets of bytes shipped around the Internet.\n\n\n\n**What is it about Cardano and its community that appeals?**\n\nI started like everyone else, on Ethereum, because its ecosystem is already mature. However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s got great fundamentals.\n\n\n\n**Can you talk about how you hope Glow will change the DApp developer experience?**\n\nGlow is portable. Today it works on Cardano and Ethereum but in the future it will work with any blockchain that is sufficiently advanced to support smart contracts. That means that you can write your DApp once and it will run on whichever platform has the users and the liquidity you seek. You don\u2019t have to make a guess about where liquidity will be in the future then sink heavy investments to develop on a single chain that you bet your house on.\n\n\n\nWith Glow, developers can run their DApps on all blockchains. Glow will commoditize blockchains. Blockchains will then compete on technical and economic merits, not on user lock-in and inertia. And the value brought to users will increase.\n\n\n\n**What can the community expect from Glow?**\n\nWe have launched this early version of Glow on the Cardano EVM Devnet with a command-line interface. In many ways, it is not yet ready for use by end-users, but it can already demonstrate simple applications. Users can also see how they may write a 6 line application in Glow that would require hundreds of lines in a combination of Solidity and JavaScript. We have a roadmap over the next few months to add a lot of features: from ERC20 tokens (and, on Cardano, native tokens), to generalized state channels, to a web interface, to a more robust runtime, etc. Eventually, we want to become the development environment for all blockchain projects. And Glow is of course an open source software open to the community.\n\n**We\u2019re rolling out the integration with Glow with our EVM and devnet program, so what are some of the benefits of this?**\n\nThe Cardano EVM side-chain will enable arbitrary contracts to run on Cardano that use the mature EVM platform, without waiting for Plutus to deliver its promise, to achieve feature-parity, to be considered stable, etc. And Glow can run on this EVM side-chain and provide the simplicity, safety and portability in DApp development that were not available before.\n\n**What is the rollout process like and how can our community get involved if they want to?**\n\nGlow is still in development. There are some things that it can do already and some it can\u2019t do yet. We invite DApp developers to join the Glow community and use the language for what it can already do, and otherwise help us build the blockchain development environment of the future. You can build the missing features you need yourself, or contract MuKn to build them for you. Even if you can\u2019t code and have no budget, you can help write the documentation, or even just tell us where it isn\u2019t clear yet, or what features you need most so we know what to prioritize. Together, we can build great DApps that you just couldn\u2019t have achieved safely and within budget with previous tools.\n\n*If you\u2019re a developer, we encourage you to get involved with [Mutual Knowledge Systems and Glow](https://mukn.io/).

This week, building on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://developers.cardano.org/en/virtual-machines/welcome/), we\u2019re rolling out a new [development environment](https://developers.cardano.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/) to support the Glow language.*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau of Mutual Knowledge Systems is the creator of Glow, a DSL that will allow anyone to write verifiable DApps from a single spec and deploy it on our EVM network. We caught up with Rideau (also known as Fare) to hear more about his vision for Glow and the Cardano journey so far. The following is a distillation of his thoughts from our previous interviews.*\n\n\n\n**We first introduced the community to GLOW and MuKn at the end of [last year](https://youtu.be/lj9SlvOIBgU?t=2902) when we announced our devnets approach \u2013\u00a0 but maybe you can remind us how you began working with IOHK?**\n\nI started as a researcher in formal methods for programming languages and distributed systems. But I wanted to build systems actually used by many, so I moved into the industry where I notably worked on proving the correctness of a centralized payment protocol and creating an airline reservation system. After a few years at Google and Bridgewater, I decided life wasn\u2019t worth working under dysfunctional hierarchies, so I started my own cryptocurrency companies. Charles invited me to speak at the IOHK Summit 2019, and I realized how much I like the Cardano community: we have a similar focus on building robust software for the long term. That is why I wanted to port my domain specific language Glow to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Tell us a bit why you started your company Mutual Knowledge Systems, or as you call it MuKn (Moon)?**\n\nOver three years ago, I was reviewing whitepapers. Most papers (about \u00be) had interesting techniques but made no economic sense. Most of the rest (about \u2155) made economic sense but had no technical content. Only the top few (about 5%) actually made sense both technically and economically. At some point, I realized I could do better, so I designed a scaling solution using lessons learned from working on Tezos. Arthur Breitman challenged me to use smart contracts instead of trying to modify his protocol. \n\nWhile trying to prove his challenge absurd, I instead found that he was right and I was wrong\u2014and I finally understood why and how to use smart contracts. I started a company around the resulting scaling solution, raised money, pivoted into building the scaling solution after the language capable of generating it from specification, fought with and fired my then-partner, became my own CEO, started a new company, and, after much struggle, finally found the right founding team. Together, we built Mutual Knowledge Systems around this new programming language, Glow\u2014designed to be much better than existing languages to write decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n**When you say \u2018better\u2019, what do you really mean?**\n\nWriting a DApp is the single hardest thing to do in the world. This is because you can\u2019t afford a mistake, or your users may lose significant funds. Furthermore, you are not confronting random situations, but active adversaries bent on attacking your code, who will contrive the very worst case scenarios to exploit for their profit. Yet, unlike the military, you can\u2019t hide your code or protect access to your networks: all the critical pieces are necessarily public. On top of that, extant programming tools are not designed for these constraints and even traditional formal methods lack essential concepts to express the issues at stake.\n\nThus, we decided to make new tools fit for the challenge. Our domain-specific language (DSL) drastically simplifies DApp development, by abstracting away all the common blockchain infrastructure, so you can focus on your problem domain (trading, derivatives, insurance, supply chain, etc.). Your DApps can be thousands of lines of code that your users can afford to audit, instead of millions of lines of code that require leaps of blind faith. And the programming model will enable developers, auditors and automated verification tools to reason at the level of abstraction of participants exchanging assets, rather than at that of packets of bytes shipped around the Internet.\n\n\n\n**What is it about Cardano and its community that appeals?**\n\nI started like everyone else, on Ethereum, because its ecosystem is already mature. However, the Ethereum community has this attitude of building as fast as possible experiments that are good enough for now, but lack conceptual integrity and won\u2019t last; I see a lot of value in that approach and have tremendous respect for those who can thrive this way\u2014for I cannot. When I met the Cardano community, I felt much more at home because we share a common attitude. We want to do things that are correct by construction and will keep working in the long term. We build concrete towers on the bedrock, not stick shacks on the sand. At times, this can be frustrating because things go slow, but I am happy with the attention to detail and quality in the development of Cardano. Is it perfect? No, it\u2019s not.

In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Decentralizing social media: a conversation with Ben Goertzel and Charles Hoskinson", "subtitle": "The minds behind SingularityNET and Cardano come together to explore a vision of the future of decentralization, AI, and social media.", "audio": null, "soundcloud": null, "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\n*At the end of 2020, we announced our collaboration with SingularityNET, in an exclusive [fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3O5F_CCT8c) between Charles Hoskinson and SingularityNET founder & CEO, Ben Goertzel.*\u00a0\n\n*SingularityNET recently shared further information on the partnership when they announced their exciting [Phase Two initiative](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a),* [](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-two-massive-token-utilization-toward-decentralized-beneficial-agi-6e3ac5a5b44a) *which includes a shift from Ethereum to Cardano, to achieve new network functionalities and launching a Stream of New AGI-ADA Tokens.*\n\n*Last week, Charles and Ben sat down again together in a special [SingularityNET podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNWJGGc7ESI). In a wide-ranging discussion, the pair explore decentralized social media, the Cardano collaboration, and how a benevolent general AI technology might help a healthier social discourse.*\n\n*Here, in this exclusive long read, we have transcribed the whole conversation for you to enjoy and savour.*\n\n*<!--EndFragment-->*\n\n**Ben Goertzel:** Alright. Pleasure to be chatting once more Charles. And I thought it'll be amazing to have an on air discussion on the topic that's been in so many people's minds recently, which is the perhaps of critical importance of decentralization for social media and social networks, because this is something we both been thinking about deeply for quite a long time and have been both moving toward action on for quite a long time in our own ways, maybe the AI spin and you with Cardano and blockchain. But now things seem to be coming to a head and the world seems to suddenly be concerned that a few large corporations are programming everyone's brains in bizarre ways. So, yeah, maybe it is cool to start out just by hearing your overview of the topic.\n\n**Charles Hoskinson:** Yeah, it's an interesting situation. So I'm kind of conflicted. So, I'm a big libertarian and the libertarian guys say, \"Hey, let the market decide. So when someone gets de-platformed, we say, \"Hey, it's a private company. They can do whatever they want.\" But the issue is collusion and so the watershed moment for me wasn't the de-platforming of Trump. I said, yeah, okay the guy violated the end user license agreement probably 9 million times. At some point you have to throw the guy out. The issue was the de-platforming of Parler, because that was a very different animal.\n\nSo the whole argument was, well, if you don't like Twitter, go compete with it, build your own social network. That's exactly what Parler did. And they had different moderation standards. But then what occurred was that all of Silicon Valley got together and they colluded and they basically jointly decided to completely de-platform Parler. So Amazon took them down, Apple took them down, Google took them down. And if you're put in a market position where 100% of the mobile market and most of the web market is basically blacklisting you and you have no way to be on a cell phone for an average consumer, no way to have a website for an average consumer without going to extraordinary lengths and it's almost like the pirate bay. You have to host servers in Afghanistan or something to escape it. That's very problematic. It feels like a standard oil controlling the shipping prices of oil back in the 19th century.\n\n**BG:** The appeal to ethics seems so disingenuous, right? It's like you can search Qanon on garbage on Google just fine. So then why is it so unethical for there to be Qanon garbage on Parler as some of the content, right?\n\nThe idea that these big tech companies are acting out of a moral necessity to save everyone's lives. I mean, it rings very hollow, right? And I mean, there's no doubt some people in those companies really are thinking that way. But the alignment of these marginal ethical arguments with obvious corporate profit interests as being advanced by explicit collusion among these big players. It makes it hard to take the ethical aspect one hundred percent seriously.\n\n**CH:** It's almost become like an ethical tautology in a certain respect. They say 'Don't be evil, except for the times you have to be.' It's a crazy, crazy statement where these companies say, well, we're trying to be moral. And I say, 'Okay, but no one elected you. And why are you guys in charge of the totality and curation flow of all information?' I very firmly believe what needs to happen is we need to split the protocols that carry the information from the interfaces that curate that information. And that feels to be a much more natural thing. The problem we have right now is the stack is vertically completely controlled by a company.\n\nSo, Google doesn't just curate what you see in the search engine. They also control the underlying engine. And so as a consequence, they can make a decision on pretty much anything and exclude people laterally. And it's the same for the app stores. It's the same for social networks. The level of collusion is very problematic. I mean, you can't tell me that they didn't talk to each other if they all de-platformed someone the same day in the same hour. It'd be one thing if it was a gradual process where maybe Google and two weeks later, Amazon, something like that. But if it's all exactly at the same time, then it means they picked up the phone and they called each other and say, well, we just decided that this is no good for you.\n\nThe problem is that decentralization doesn't solve the underlying problem that they're complaining about, which is radicalization. The issue is that the way information is being presented, it's manipulating our cognitive biases. We're creatures of cognitive biases. No matter how smart we are, we have availability bias, and selection bias and confirmation biases. There's hundreds of them and social scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists, they think about these things and quantify them. And if you digitize those biases and you build algorithms to exploit them, then what ends up happening is you create echo chambers. So you create these silos. Each and every one of those silos they are incapable of getting out of it. There's no idea flow between them. So all you do when you decentralize that, if you don't solve that underlying problem is you make the silos more resilient.\n\n**BG:** I mean there's a problem when you're applying AIs to learn to win in games or video games, which is both a problem and a benefit is that the AI will learn to do what you asked it to do. So if you're asking it to get maximum points in this game, and there's a way to do it by hacking around the rules of the game in some weird way no human would ever think of, the AI will explore various options. And if it's working well, will find some route to achieve the objective function without taking into account whatever implicit constraints you had about what's the artful way to do it.\n\nI think something similar exists with social media companies. They have certain metrics and objectives they're working toward. Often very, systemically internally, right? I mean, they want people to be looking at their site as long as possible, for example, or they want them to be spending as much as possible clicking on ads. And they'll put a lot of human and algorithmic effort into optimizing toward that goal. And then we can't be very surprised that these groups of brilliant people make cool software build systems that are optimizing toward that goal, like via whatever hacks they can find. And those hacks include exploiting human cognitive biases and exploiting dynamics of addiction in the human brain and all sorts of human, emotional patterns. Exploiting human angst and the desperation and existential confusion. I mean the algorithms and the corporate systems will exploit whatever they can to achieve the goals they're given.\n\nAnd as you say, it's organized so that these corporate organisms, which are now hybrid human and digital computing process organisms. These corporate organisms are almost like a parasite on modern society and they're achieving their own goal pretty effectively. If you took a bird's eye view of human society and where we want to be and where we want to go during the next few years, and maybe leading towards the singularity and creation of AGI and all that. A situation where these corporate human/computer networks orient toward maximizing shareholder value by getting you to buy stuff online and stare at their website as long as possible.\n\nI mean, these sorts of organizations having that much power is not the optimal dynamic for shaping the collective mind, heart and soul of humanity, right? I mean it's pretty far off from where we want to be. You'd imagine that extremism and siloeing and tribalism, which we're seeing online and in real life, I think that's probably the only scratching the surface of the screwed up patterns that are being fostered. That's the surface layer where it's easy to see how screwed up it is. And there's so many other screwed up individual and collective dynamics that are happening. I wouldn't say all caused by this organization of social media in the tech industry, but certainly co-evolving with it and codependent on it.\n\n**CH:** Well, it's an interesting thing. So I tend to agree with Max Tegmark in this respect where you invent the car first and then you invent the safety belt. With new technology or new processes, there's a lack of wisdom in the safety components of it until after you've suffered the consequences. So, we looked at the oil and gas industry in the 19th century, they started drilling all these wells and only after they started doing that, did we start thinking about environmentalism. And we said, well, maybe it's not such a good idea just to have unrestricted oil well drilling. Maybe we need to think carefully about what this is actually doing to the environment.\n\nWell, the oil of the 21st century is really the attention economy and the data economy. And we have all this surveillance capitalism and we have all these early pioneering firms and they're effectively mining that. And they're creating a social environmental damage by this process, to use an analogy where these algorithms are built and these platforms were built away to exacerbate human nature. So to your point that they didn't cause it, but I'd certainly say that they're exacerbating it and-\n\n**BG:** I always think of everything in human society from the end game of legacy humanity. Like we're working on creating AGI. If we can create a benevolent AGI, I mean, this is going to make our current problems seem so archaic and silly. Of course, things won't be perfect. There will be new problems we can't imagine there. But this is certainly the biggest threshold event in the history of humanity, perhaps of life on earth. We could be a few decades from that even less. If there's even a decent odds that this singularitarian view is true, I mean then how the collective mind of humanity is shaped is insanely important, right?\n\nBecause the first AGI probably isn't going to be just a stupid human, stupid mind in a box, totally separate from human society. The way things are going it's more likely to come out of the interaction of multiple different AI components made by multiple parties, serving useful economic functions in the world at large. If the first AGI, which triggers this singularity is coming out of the whole mess of the tech ecosystem and people using the technology to do useful things, I mean then how messy that mess is, is an extremely important thing. And that right now, the direction does not look like the internet AI tech ecosystem is evolving in a great configuration for spotting a benevolent super AGI, 5, 10 to 20 years from now, right? Maybe some redirection if some of the sub-networks in there, like the ones we're involved with could affect it. Some redirection would be highly beneficial.\n\n**CH:** Well, the problem with AGI is that that's kind of like the Deus ex Machina situation where you're saying, well, we could solve this problem if we have this insanely powerful tool. And it's like, well, yeah, but maybe we don't actually need a tool that powerful to make meaningful progress towards this problem.\n\n**BG:** Decentralized social networks you don't need AGI. Absolutely not. You can do a lot with blockchain networks.\n\n**CH:** Hang on. So I think an AI solution does provide a lot of value, but I look at it more like a cognitive crutch. So if you injure your leg you get on crutches or you walk with a cane or something like that. I recently had a gout attack and for two weeks I was on a cane. So it's kind of funny. We physically think about this, but for the mental stuff, we don't really think we need it. We say, oh, our brains are perfectly well functions. Like no, we're dopamine addicts. We're constantly manipulated by digital devices and we're in a situation where we're not acting rationally or objectively most of the time.\n\n**BG:** With access to our hardware and software. We can't fix the bugs in the direct way.\n\n**CH:** So the question is, what would be the simplest possible agent, intelligent agent that could be constructed that could act as a cognitive crutch to alert us if we are being manipulated or our behavior is exhibiting patterns that have been propagandized. That feels like it would be a massive step forward.\n\n**BG:** Now we're getting it. Some of this stuff that I'm hoping we will be able to build together with a SingularityNET on the Cardano network over the next few years. I mean, if you look at intelligent virtual assistants now like an Alexa or Google assistant, I mean, A: these things are very stupid in many senses, right? I mean, I have a Google Home Max. I used to play music in my house and the system still hasn't realized I never listen to music with vocals during the day. I mean, it doesn't have that metadata there. It hasn't recognized that very simple pattern, so repeatedly throw stuff at me. I won't listen to it. It's not even able to understand extremely simple repeated patterns in human behavior, which would help them make more money, even by showing me more stuff I want to listen to, right?\n\nSo these systems are optimized very narrowly to serve certain functions and their functions certainly are not to help us navigate the universe of the internet and media, in a way that's optimal for our own growth and self understanding, achieving our own goals and optimizing the collective intelligence of humanity. Very, far from it. So one could envision a personal assistant that had a bit more general intelligence. So it understood at least a little bit of what we actually want and are doing, but also was not controlled by a mega corporation with the primary goal of making them money, but was controlled by us who were being assisted by the personal assistant, right?\n\nI mean, I don't want the human personal assistant working for me, helping me do things whose main goal is to make some other corporation money, right? I want the human personal assistant working for me whose goal is to help me because I hired them to help me, right?\n\nAnd we should have digital assistants like that and they're going to be building machine learning models of everything we're doing like a human assistant builds their own biological model of what their employer is doing. And we should be better than the human assistant. We should be able to explicitly inspect what that model is and edit and correct it if we didn't like it and delete that model if we want to, right? So, I mean, we need among other things, we need intelligent virtual agents to help guide our navigation of the whole internet information sphere, which are secure and decentralized and explainable to us. The thing is we can do that without AGI. We can do that with technology we have right now, and this technology can help along the path toward AGI.\n\n**CH:** Where do we get the training data from? That was the one thing I was thinking about is how do I train an agent like that?\n\n**BG:** I mean it's going into smartphones that we use all day, right? So the training day that Google and Amazon and so forth are using, where does it come from? It comes from all of us. In principle, you can download most of what Google is basing its training data on you on, but very few of us are doing it. We're not using it, right? So, I mean, clearly you need all the data that you're using to interact with devices and with people all day. I mean you need that data to be in a secure data world that's owned and controlled by you where you're confident it's being managed and secure. Yeah, but we got to get a little deeper. I mean, it's not just interaction use. You'd have to clearly show an example of confirmation bias to an extent that an ML model would be able to understand that. And so how do you do that in an unsupervised way?\n\n**BG:** We show it all the time, right? And I mean if the AI has a view of a lot of people, I mean, even those of us who are especially clever in some ways and our basic human social, emotional interactions, there's a lot that we do, which is the same.\n\nEmotional interactions. There's a lot that we do, which is the same as a lot of other people are doing, right? Like in how you interact with an employee versus a romantic partner or a friend or someone who's arguing with you. I think the sort of dialogue meta games and the inner dialogue meta games that people are playing, they're within the scope of current advanced neuro AI tech to recognize it's just, that's not what's being focused on. What's being focused on is recognizing subtle patterns and who's going to click on what ad. And I mean, you don't need to tell that to predict who's going to click on what ad in the most concise and effective way. I mean, you don't care. Right?\n\nIt's just a principle problem that the tech industry is not currently trying very hard to solve, but yeah, you're right. You focus on the AI part and I focus on the blockchain part. But in reality, I mean, you need them because I guess the other guy's part is harder because we understand how to solve our part. But I mean, you need both of them. I mean, you need the secure, scalable data ecosystem, respecting data sovereignty and you need that to fuel intelligent virtual assistants that really serve the person that they're assisting is the prime directive. Plus this massive scale data analytics that really understands what's going on with each of us in a way that lets it genuinely help us.\n\nBecause what is giving a person what they want? Does it mean gratifying their most intense short-term impulse at each moment? Or does it mean giving them what they want in a sort of balance along multiple timescales? Which is at multiple levels of our being, which is what we try to do with our family and our human friends. And AI's, they're laughably far from making an effort to give us what we want and in the more profound sense at the moment.\n\n**CH:** Right? Well, the reason why I was focusing on the AI part is the biggest part, the blockchain part, the incentives engineering relies very heavily upon the users and the agents inside the system. And so we say, \"Okay, how do we incentivize people to supervise and curate data and agents in a way that we get more dialogue and we get a great moderation?\" The ideal form would be, if you take clique's that are disjoint and you put them in the system, then idea flow starts occurring between them. And over time they'll converge into kind of a great moderated middle.\n\nSo you can take a very extremist person and either the system acts like it has an immune system and it kind of kicks them out or that node over time, moderates. The incentives in the system have to be designed that way. The reason we have so many problems in my view with Facebook and Twitter is that it actually has the opposite incentive. You get more clicks and more interaction with the more polarized people become. So the system is built in a way to polarize people as much as possible and thus divide them as much as possible. Because it's actually boosting revenue.\n\n**BG:** I think that's an easier problem to solve. Righteous indignation and the glorious feeling being approved by others in your ingroup and jointly indignant of the guys in the next group. This is a really easy emotion to manipulate with people. It's sort of a low hanging fruit. And to an extent these networks implicitly got stuck in manipulating this low-hanging fruit because it was the easiest way to keep people staring at their app. I mean, just as the internet settled on porn with love, it's been with. Because that's a really low algorithmic complexity way to keep people staring at something, is to show them naked bodies. So, if something would give greater benefit and even get people to start their site longer in the long run, but it isn't quite as simple of a problem, it sort of gets bypassed in the loop of trying to incrementally achieve these metrics more and more each month.\n\nAnd what's interesting is that the thought that rearranging sort of the configuration of the tech stack as you suggest in the beginning of the conversation, so like rearranging the tech stack so that the protocols are separate from the applications and then the AI models and tools used to create the AI models and inspect the AI models, they're also separate from the applications. I mean, reorganizing things in this way, then it sort of opens up the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in a way that I believe has decent odds of leading to the evolution of social media tools that they give people what they want in a more profound sense. And in doing so, they're creating communication networks among people that are not focused entirely on sort of immediate gratification of the ego and soaking of inter tribal rivalries and so forth.\n\nBecause all these good and beautiful things we're alluding to, exist on the internet right now. They exist on the internet right now. There's love, there's compassion, there's true connection between people with rival political views or from different historical tribes and so forth. It's not that we're not capable of that or that it isn't there. People are capable of amazing deep connections with other people and have incredible self-awareness and uplifting of their own consciousness. It's just, you need networks that foster this rather than trying to squash it and channel you into tribalism and immediate ego gratification. And of course neither you or I nor our teams are going to build all the systems that solve this problem. So you're going to create the ecosystem and tool set in which the solutions are going to emerge.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the point of incentives engineering is that it's the initial push. And because you don't have friction to slow you down, you tend to accelerate and eventually you get to a great place. I mean, Bitcoin obviously got their incentives engineering right. And they went from a single miner to warehouses of miners all around the world. And now this colossal system. We can argue about the power consumption, but that model was quite competitive to a point that it created a trillion dollar ecosystem. So I often think, \"Well, what incentives do we need?\" And we kind of have three sets of distinct things we need to accomplish at the same time if the network is going to be sustainable and useful to society.\n\nSo one thing is that you would like information to be curated, where it can clearly separate objective reality from the subjective analysis of it and give people a diverse set of viewpoints and understand that stuff is nuanced. So if they get that, then you kind of get rid of the fake news. You also get some consensus in the network of baseline facts. Because right now we live in a reality where people can't even agree to basic things. Some people think coronavirus is a hoax. Some people think vaccines are poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. So there's just disjoint realities that people are in. It used to be we would have one set of facts. We'd agree on that. But then our interpretation of what those means-\n\n**BG:** It's true. A lot of people really believed Donald Trump had the most people at his inauguration ever, and the New Yorker doctored those images. And of course, sometimes the mainstream media may have distorted something about Trump, but the thing is, that's like an image, right? And people didn't believe the photograph, they believed the photograph was fake. And when you're at that point where people don't believe the photographs, then it's very hard. Then you have to be on the ground there, observing it in a sort of very clear state of mind to believe anything.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm not even a realist or materialist fundamentally. I don't know if there is an objective reality. But what people are doing is they're not thinking in a clear and coordinated way about this belief they have or this thing they'd been told. What evidence is that grounded in? What's the process of grounding the abstraction or the claim in the evidence? That process is broken. And it's partly because of AI and advanced informatics tools. Because you can make a deep fake. I mean, it's actually hard to tell if this video is Goertzel and Hoskinson or is this video a deep fake of Goertzel and Hoskinson put up by someone to troll all of us. It's not immediate seeing is believing to tell that you have to think.\n\n**CH:** Oh yeah. Like the Collider, George Lucas, deep fakes are extraordinary. And that's last generation technology. Where they're going in a few years is going to be socially very damaging because you'll have these perfect simulacrums of major figures and there'll be saying and doing terrible things. So that's the first part, the curation, go ahead?\n\n**BG:** You need the social network to tell bullshit from reality. So if the social network is broken, then you can't tell because you can't tell by looking, you can only tell by what you read and what others are saying, right?\n\n**CH:** Right. And I think that's why they're proactively de-platforming people and controlling flow of information because there's a political terror about the consequences of deep fakes and what they're going to do to dialogue.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, the point they're going to come to.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. Put a pin in that because there's two more points. So, as I mentioned, the first is just the curation of the information itself. And putting it in a way that it promotes instead of siloing idea flow, idea quality, separation of objective reality from subjective reality. And then when you're looking at the subjective to give you a spectrum of viewpoints, almost like a next-generation Nolan chart to show you different viewpoints.\n\nOkay, so then second there's clearly a data economy that exists. And surveillance capitalism is not just a nice term. It's a multi-billion perhaps trillion dollar economy. It's very valuable to society in certain respects. It allows you to micro target people. It allows you to have more friction-free commerce. You get the right products to the right people. So there's a huge advertising model and that shouldn't go away, but it should respect the privacy of the individual.\n\nSo there's been a lot of attempts to explore better ad models like with Brave and BATs, for example. I think whatever social network you create, you have to move in that particular direction where people are able to monetize their data and preserve their privacy, and actually get a share of the profit from the interactions that they have. And then the third design goal has to be the infrastructure itself is horrendously expensive to maintain. I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data. All these systems have N squared plus interactions. And so as your social network gets to a billion people, that quadratic complexity becomes very difficult to curate and manage. So the computational cost of that infrastructure, there's a reason why Google is so big and Amazon is so big and Facebook is so big.\n\nSo you somehow have to figure out how you subsidize a decentralized distributed system to curate and store all of that information. And you actually have to make data and users an economic actor, or they get pruned out if they don't contribute enough to the system. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that in a much simpler sense with just smart contracts and these big systems.\n\nI mean, you see things like IPFS and Gollum and other attempts to distribute network and data and storage. But if those protocols are imperfect, and when you talk about a social network, you talk about people posting videos, every day, 4k videos. You talk about people posting pictures every day, sometimes 100s of them, millions of meaningful interactions, even a small clique. If you take an extended family, that's going to be over a month's time, probably a million plus interactions of various things from likes and thumbs up. And then you're adding these intelligent agents that also have to do an enormous amount of processing on a regular basis. And those agents are only going to get more sophisticated and be interacted with a lot. So you have to have a lot of that be handled by the edges, the end user.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that's hard. I mean, we've been working on that with a project called NewNET, which is spun off of SingularityNET. And I think we understand a lot about the architecture that has to be there and about how this sort of split up machine learning algorithms for this sort of a hardware infrastructure. But there's a lot of work to be done there. There's a lot of avenues for inter-operation of NewNET, SingularityNET, and Cardano there. But I mean, it's hard. It's hard to do computer science and software engineering. And on the other hand, obviously Google and Amazon and Microsoft have solved a lot of really hard large-scale software engineering problems, different ones. But I mean, I think with a fraction of the effort that they put in, I think we can solve that problem.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, they're cheating because they always have a trusted third party. And so that massively simplifies your protocol. Their problem is easier. This is a harder problem. But on the other hand, computer science and hardware have both advanced a lot since they started doing what they're doing. But yeah, the incentive engineering aspect, incentive design aspect is quite critical and quite fascinating and exists for end users and also just within the developer community. Because I mean, what you see now is the significant majority of AI PGS, and we're going to work for these big tech companies. Or start a startup, which then gets acquired by one of these big tech companies. So the incentive structures of end users and of developers have sort of been channeled. They've been channeled around these large tech companies, which is an amazing achievement. I would be proud if I created one of them. On the other hand, it's not optimal, but it's doing the course of society.\n\nAnd I mean, this is one thing that interests me, in our own collaboration over the next few years. I've been working with my team in SingularityNET to architect a five-year tentative plan for how to roll out and grow SingularityNET on Cardano platform. I mean, part of this involves the AGI token, the new AGI on the ada token that we're working to launch as a new version of Singularity AGI token. Because we need the AGI token to be the right sort of incentive mechanism, largely on the backend. For AI algorithm developers and for AI application developers who are building these applications backending on the AI, you need the incentivization there to work right in order to create the systems that will be creating the right incentive structures for end users.\n\n**BG:** And I think things like the Catalyst Program within Cardano or a very interesting step there. I mean, where in Catalyst community members democratically vote with some liquid democracy mechanisms that they vote on, which Cardano projects should get some tokens. And I've been watching and participating now, and then on the Catalyst discussions. And I want to do something that's a lot like that with some added dimensions, for SingularityNET on Cardano for fostering the community and expanding the community to build AI applications on our shared decentralized network. Because you need the right incentive structures on all these different levels and they need to coordinate together, which is hard. But I mean, there I think Tokenomics sort of gives you an advantage over what the big tech has because it's more scriptable and it's more flexible than the money and stock options and the incentive mechanisms they have.\n\n**CH:** Well, what's so cool about Catalyst is there's at the end of this year, going to be at least probably a $100 million worth of value that's available to the community. And the partnership with IdeaScale is just the beginning. We keep adding more and more firms to assist us with figuring out how to build a productive voting community, because it's not just the raw participation. So we say, \"Hey, I think about two, 3% of ada holders are right now in idea scale, Because it's still kind of in a beta form. Our goal is to get that to 50% before the end of the year.\" But then we were trying to identify what meaningful participation means?\n\nBecause I would argue the American election system is not meaningful at all. You just show up and vote, but whether you spent hours thinking carefully about it, or you just voted randomly, it doesn't really matter. And the system doesn't differentiate that. So you end up with very poor outcomes and rational ignorance and a race to the bottom, effectively. So, meaningful participation is something we're definitely very interested in. And our hypothesis is that's going to lead to significantly better funding outcomes. So our return on intention is quite good for the system. \n\nIt gives you this M & M thing. It feels so empty without M & M, maintenance and moonshots. So maintenance means that you can maintain the system as it is and iterate and refine and evolve, and moonshots means that you have enough money to go pursue a high risk, high return research. And most great societies do this through some vehicle. It can be the Horizons program, the European Union, or it can be DARPA in the United States where they say, \"All right, we're going to throw a bunch of money at some crazy stuff.\" And the odds are, it's probably not all going to work out. In fact, we seldom get exactly what we want, but then every now and then, we get fiber optic cables and satellites and the internet, and we get self-driving cars, and we get CALO and these other cool things.\n\nThe value to any DApp that comes over to Cardano is that you get to reuse the catalyst stack at some point, and then you can start entertaining, \"Well, what does a treasury system look like within our ecosystem?\" So, let's look three, five years out into the future, and let's say SingularityNET's gotten a lot of adoption. There's tons of transaction volume. You could put a slight tax on each transaction that can go into a treasury system for all the AGI holders. And then suddenly, you now have a mini catalyst just for AGI, and you can follow your own M & M strategy. So one part can say, \"Hey, we just want to add more agents and more capabilities,\" and the other part can say, \"Let's go tackle a super hard problem in the AI space.\" And it's really risky to go chase that problem. It may be the Holy Grail AGI, or it could be a subset of that or a compositional subset where you can decompose that problem to a collection of subproblems, and you're solving one of them. And if you fail, it's okay. And if you succeed, that solution lives in the open domain, and it's not controlled by a company. It's controlled by a protocol, so it's ubiquitously accessible.\n\n**BG:** So with what we're planning out now with a certain amount of AGI ADA tokens, I think we can do something catalyst based that can help get AI developers on the SingularityNET on Cardano platform and can help build toward both applied narrow AI in domains from social media to medicine, to DeFi as well as other components toward AGI. But there's also much bigger things. Like if you think about it, we're competing with these trillion-dollar companies, right, so I mean, eventually, we need custom hardware for decentralized AGI. If there is enough usage, as you say, a modest fee on usage can, can drive catalyst-based funding of research. And I mean, you could fund the design and prototyping of decentralized AGI chips, right?\n\nI mean, ultimately, we need to be seeding these exponential economic growth processes to the point where there's more wealth in the decentralized AI ecosystem than there is in the centralized AI ecosystem, which sounds very fanciful now. But I mean, I'm a lot older than you. I'm old enough to remember the computer\u00a0\n\ncompanies were like Honeywell right? No one believed that PC companies were going to supply them, let alone internet companies like online ad agencies. Right? But this is how things go. And I mean, in the same way, the potential for network effects and exponential growth based on the right incentive mechanisms on multiple layers... The potential is there for a decentralized AI ecosystem to grow much bigger than the current trillion dollar companies. I mean, you just need to see the right growth processes in place. And I think, between our communities and codebases, we're able to see what those are right now, but of course, getting that seeding to work involves an endless number of difficult subproblems, both technological and human.\n\n**CH:** Right. Well, that's the value of trade. Bob makes the spear, and Alice makes the rope. So one of the things we're trying to focus on in Cardano is abstracting the toolsets and capabilities of the protocol so that each DApp that comes can reuse that, and they don't have to be a domain expert.\n\n**BG:** That's what got me to fall in love with Cardano in the first place. It's like, this is actually a reasonable software architecture, right? I mean, you're using functional programming. You're breaking things down into pieces. So if I want to take some AI algorithm and make it do homomorphic encryption or multi-party computing, so it runs in a secure and scalable way, I don't need to write all that code myself. There's actually tools within the blockchain infrastructure that are useful as code when you're on the AI level. I mean, Ethereum is super cool. Launching smart contracts into the world was a landmark thing, but I mean, the Ethereum codebase is not like that. There's nothing in there you're going to reference or use within your secure AI layer.\n\n**CH:** Well, the computation model is just wrong. It's got a global state, and so you can't grow beyond a certain amount.\n\n**BG:** It's supposed to be a world computer, but you cannot build a functional world computer that way.\n\n**CH:** No. You have to go from global to local. And then you just have so many problems in that model. In fact, we just had a lecture this morning with Manuel Chavravarty talking about the differences with the extended UTX cell model to the Ethereum style accounts model. And we'll publish that video probably next week, but it just becomes so obviously self-evident that while it's a great proof of concept, the system... First, it can't scale. And second, the use of other utilities comes at the same resources for everything. So whether you're using a voting system, or you're using a stablecoin or a DEX, it all comes from one pool of finite resources. So if one of those resources gets over consumed by a Crypto Kitties, it makes all the other resources in the system more expensive. And that's a bizarre and asinine model. If a catalyst, for example, runs as a side chain of Cardano's... So let's say we have tons of DApps bombarding that, using that for the voting systems for their DApp, that will have no impact at all on the main chain performance.\n\n**BG:** A hundred US dollars in gas for you to swap transactions.\n\n**CH:** I know.\n\n**BG:** And how can you obsolete Wall Street that way? I mean, it's going to be tough, right? But on the other hand, I think the foundational algorithms to get around those problems are there in Cardano. And then, in SingularityNET, we have foundational algorithms for distributing and decentralizing secure AI. So, I mean, I think ingredients are there for what needs to be done. On the downside, none of us has the war chest that Google and Amazon and Apple and Microsoft do, so we have to work around that by being cleverer than them and designing the right incentive mechanisms so that you get positive feedback effects and network effects, and things can really grow. And I think that this year is going to be pivotal actually, but we're going to... I mean, you've got native assets coming out, and we'll be putting AGI token as a native asset, and then a few other SingularityNET spin offs as native assets.\n\nBut I mean, we're going to get to a flourishing native asset ecosystem in Cardano, and then SingularityDAO, which is a DeFi system we're building on SingularityNET, I mean, we can use to help coordinate getting liquidity into all these Cardano native assets. I'm super psyched about that coming out publicly because not many people are thinking about what you can do when you have a real programming language as a smart contract framework, which security by design is built in. So, I mean, I think we're really providing stuff that is prepared to explode in an incredible way in 2021.\n\n**CH:** Yeah. So first about the treasury management, Tesla 2008 was a day away from bankruptcy, and now it's worth more than Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford and GM combined. I mean, it's just crazy how fast they grew. So treasuries can grow exponentially if you get to a certain... It's almost like a standing ovation model where a few people stand up and clap, and then eventually you hit this point, and then everybody just gets up and claps. And it's the same thing, I think, with capital and companies. There's a few pivotal moments that you have where you're just right at this explosive growth, and then boom, the hockey stick happens, and then suddenly you have a lot there. And I think that's happening in the crypto industry. I remember when we hit a billion dollars with Bitcoin, and I was like, \"Wow, this is incredible.\" We could never fathom a trillion dollars. It was a crazy concept, and that had happened within eight years of that point. It took nearly five years for it to get to a billion. So it's extraordinary how quickly things can grow.\n\nThen in terms of the collaboration, getting to that, Plutus is coming very soon, and we have this test net coming out. What we're doing is we're going to beat the hell out of it. So we'd love for your guys to beat the hell out of it with the SingularityDAO.\n\n**BG:** Beat the hell out of it. That's right. Yeah.\n\n**CH:** We're a little easier because we have the Hard Fork Combinator, but your mistakes tend to sit around forever. Like we made a lot of protocol design mistakes with Byron, and we still have to support them. And so we found a really nice way of doing that. But when we released version one of Plutus and the extended UTXO model and native asset standard, that's probably not going to be perfect because nothing is. As an engineer, version one's there, but yet we have to be backwards compatible. So when you go to version two, you still have to support version one. So to me, it's super important that we get as many people as quickly as possible, beat the hell out of the native assets standard, beat the hell out of, especially Plutus, before we do the next hard fork to bring that in because I would rather not be backwards compatible with obviously wrong things as we are with Byron.\n\nSo it's great to have you guys around. I know that the code you're going to write is very novel, and it's also going to push the system to its limits. And you're going to create a very strong demand for performance and scale, I think. And I can already see several areas where we would like to use AI, for example, transaction fees. We have this fee parameter, and that's right now set with the update system, so the minimum transaction fee is a DDoS parameter. It'd be so cool once we have Oracles and DEXs within the system, and we have some notion of the value of ada relative to the US dollar, to create an automated transaction monetary policy that can take those data points and compare them to other networks real-time, and then try to make sure that we always have a compatible-\n\n**BG:** This is actually a subtle point that we've been discussing between SingularityNET platform team and Cardano platform team, right? Because I mean, the transaction framework for Cardano now, and that's planned for common native assets, it's fine from what we're doing with SingularityNet at this moment, but if we want to go to a swarm AI or microservices model, where you have a whole bunch of little AIs that within the second, one AI is consulting others to create others. I mean, if you really want to get AI by this dynamic microservices architecture, I want to have this using the blockchain rather than all off on the side. I mean, you need a way for some sub-networks to have substantially lower transaction fees, but then you need some system that's intelligent in some sense to regulate and moderate that because you still need to protect against DDoS attacks and then all sorts of other things, right. So there's a lot of areas like that where some machine learning, participating in the infrastructure can help a lot. And one of the things it can help with is to help make the system better able to manifest the emergence of higher levels of intelligence and learning, right, so you got a lot of positive cycles there.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, and you want it to be deterministic yet dynamic. And you would also like it to be globally aware of competition. So you'd like the agents to be able to parse all the competing blockchains and look at their monetary policies, look at their transaction policies or transaction rates and their relative values to each other, and then be able to pull that into Cardano and form a transaction policy based on that.\n\n**BG:** It is there, right. I mean, the data is there online. You can download it into your AI, and I think that's quite feasible. So, yeah, going back to decentralized social networks, where we started, I mean, there's been, as you know, and you've looked at this in more depth than me even... I mean, there's been loads and loads of attempts to make decentralized social networks. There's dozens of cool projects started by smart well-intentioned people with the right vision. Obviously, none of them has yet become the next Facebook or Twitter. I mean, some like Minds.com from Bill Ottman, I think, is really cool, but I log on there not yet as often, even as I log onto Facebook, which is not that often, right. I mean, Mines is great. It just doesn't have such a critical mass of people yet, although it's done a way, way better job than the vast majority of decentralized social networks, right?\n\nSo how do we get Minds and Everipedia and dozens of other decentralized social network platforms and the new ones that haven't been heard of yet... How do we get these to really take off? And I think we share the conclusion that a lot of what's needed there is to make the underlying stack more amenable to lower costs, larger-scale operations of the needed kinds, both in data storage and processing distribution, and then the distributed AI, also. It's interesting, Jack Dorsey from Twitter has seen this also, and they're looking at making a decentralized protocol and reorganizing the Twitter stack. The question there is, can you really make that work with incentive structures that are implicit in Twitter as the company that it is?\n\n**CH:** That's why I separate the base protocol from the interface, like what Steem did. They had the Steem protocol and then Steem at the interface, and their problem was that they didn't have a full end to end monetary policies, so they had value leakage. There was no incentive to buy the token, but they used the token to curate information. Had they solved that problem, it would be still around and much larger, but I think that Twitter can survive with a decentralized social network protocol because it would just be a very popular, curated interface to it, and they'd still have their network effect. It's just the customers, and the data would be ephemeral. They could flow from one interface to another interface and get that same experience. The problem right now is you have to rebuild the network effect every time you launch a new one of these things. Every time we want to do an internet application, we have to completely rebuild the internet underneath it. It's a preposterous thing, right? Yeah.\n\n**BG:** It makes sense, and I think it's visionary of Jack Dorsey to even entertain the notion, right? I mean, not many corporations of that scale are willing to-\n\n**CH:** Well, it's a proactive solution to a big problem he has because if he plays censor and chief and he has to de-platform people from the protocol, then he can never win.\n\n**BG:** I wouldn't want that job either because, I mean, you got people that are clearly colluding to kill someone. Fine. You ban them. You have people who are saying stuff that's nasty but not yet criminal. And then I don't want them to be in the job of telling what's too nasty and what's okay. I mean, court systems aren't perfect at that, but I mean, they've been honed for that over significant periods of time, and you don't want to have to do that at fast speed and large scale as part of operating your tech company. And I mean, none of these tech companies actually want that job, right. That's not why they got into the business, like how can I censor people's political speech? So, I mean, of course, if things can be reorganized so that that job is done by the community for the community, rather than having to be done by the CEO. I mean, that's far, far better. And the community won't do it perfectly, but actually, it will do a better job than these centralized authorities. And I mean, it's completely possible to do that. \n\nWe did a lot of simulations of Singularity 's machine learning-moderated reputation system over the last couple of years. You can make decentralized, AI-guided rating and reputation systems and you can tune them and you can see if I tune it one way, you get information silos, if you tune it another way, you just get trolls and spammers and so forth. If you tune it in a different way, you get a system that self-policing and fosters a healthy level of interaction. And you can do this to get networks that self-regulate without anyone giving top level control. If this is operating within the current global political systems, which I have my issues with too, as I'm sure you do, but it's there, then you still have top level control over things that are clear crimes, according to the nation states people's bodies are sitting in, but you don't need top level control for anything else.\n\nAnd I think that not just would avoid garbage like minds are proud of being de-platformed. It would also create something that's a breeding ground for positive and creative and beneficial content in which people's minds are being nudged toward positive growth, rather than channeled into this site and click on this ad. I think potential is there to do that. What's a little scary is that handful of us in the decentralized AI space, the two of us, probably understand more about how to achieve this than anyone else on the planet. It's actually a very big and significant problem, both in terms of setting the stage for a positive singularity and just making life less shitty for humanity on the planet at this moment.\n\n**CH:** The one thing I've always learned from being a cryptocurrency guy is that incentives are king, and it's always been an incentives problem. How many people were, in 1990, being paid to think about social networks? You'd probably be in the sociology department at Harvard or something that, or toying around in an MIT AI group or something. But it wasn't a real job and nobody would understand. How many people who are experts in how to build effective social networks are floating around now? There's thousands of them. They're fabulously wealthy. So if you show that in a free market system you can achieve great wealth, or at least the prospect of great wealth by building a system of a certain design, then you'll end up getting a lot of it.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space was exactly the same. How many people were experts in Bitcoin-like systems in 2010? Very few. Now in 2021, now the existing chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Gensler, he was lecturing at MIT on cryptocurrencies. That's how far we've gone in just such a short period of time because the incentives are right. So when I look at this problem, I say, \"Well, how do we get the incentives in the right way to encourage a large clique of people to come in and actually start applying serious hardcore brainpower to these types of problems?\" So it's a first mover situation. Now, to the minds and these other guys, to that earlier point you brought up, I look at them almost like mechanical horses. When we were first thinking, how do we build a better horse? If we all let's build a robot horse, or a steam powered horse or something like that. Well now there's this automobile idea that we've been toying around with. Maybe that's just a fundamentally more competitive or better model.\n\nOr similarly, when people are thinking about vacuum tubes, you can certainly optimize them, and I'm sure you could build a much better vacuum tube today than they were building back in the 1940s. But obviously that was superseded by the transistor. So similarly, when you look at social networks, we have to say what is our automobile moment to replace the horse?\" And minds is not it. I think that if those things existed, they'd actually just be worse than Facebook or Twitter. They'd get far more siloed. The three problems I outlined, the great moderation, the incentives models being aligned so that people can actually make money and produce money and do useful things with the system, and the infrastructure funding problem.\n\nYou have to solve all three of those with one protocol design and one incentives design. And if you do that, then it's going to be this massive beacon that will attract tons of people to come in and start working on an augmented system and evolve it. And it doesn't matter if it starts very small. It'll go very viral and eventually get to that Tesla-style hockey stick, when Tesla figured out the entire model. Plenty of battery-powered cars before, but their particular model was the one that everything came together and then it had exponential.\n\n**BG:** In terms of tokenomics systems, it's quite interesting. Because having a unified scheme and dynamic for promoting the right incentives doesn't mean just one token. So you're sculpting multiple tokens in a multi-token ecosystem where they interoperate. So say we have ada, we the AGI token on ada, and for, say, a decentralized social network running on ada, leveraging SingularityNET AI, potentially could involve a different token for a certain purpose within that network. You have to think through the inter interoperation of these different networks. And I think that this is one of the things I'm most excited about in collaboration between the two of us and between SingularityNET and Cardano. I think you guys have done very well in thinking through incentive structures and how they boil down into tokenomic structures. I look forward to some cognitive synergy among us on that.\n\n**CH:** We learned how much we don't know. We started this program at Oxford with Elias, and he's an algorithmic game theorist. He won the G\u00f6del Prize and all these things. He's a really good guy, and he's got some... Yeah, Oxford, he's got some really good graduate students too, so we said, \"Okay, between him and his graduate students, we're done. Put a fork in it. We should easily be able to tackle all these consensus incentives problems in Ouroboros.\" It took two years to refine the entire incentive model just for a consensus algorithm, and now we're talking about incentives for the curation of information. So it's going to be fun to collaborate. I agree there. It's such a hard problem.\n\n**BG:** Curation of information that's being created by just decentralized AI algorithms, not just of existing information.\n\n**CH:** Yeah, because you need to create demand for a token and you need to be able to use that token because it's demanded and it's valuable to incentivize a certain collection of human behavior. You also need to be able to use that to incentivize people to interact with agents in a way that they could become trained to become good cognitive crutches to reinforce the network, and then that token also has to incentivize the hosting of decentralized infrastructure that eventually can scale to petabyte scale storage and huge network capacity and massive computational capacity. It's a tall order. It's a lot of incentive engineering, and that's why I don't think these networks exist yet.\n\n**BG:** They don't. As you say, once it's gotten to a certain level, the potential to gain both personal wealth and to help promote broad benefit to a huge degree, those are both there in a very clear way, which I think can cause a rush of talent into the space of decentralized AI and decentralized AI guided social networks. We're at a pivotal moment now, I think, in terms of both the readiness and even eagerness of the world for these technologies and the existence of the needed tools, or at least a significant fraction of the needed tools to create them. This conversation is occurring in a quite interesting time.\n\n**CH:** But the good news is that there's a lot of almost right attempts, like the creation of Bitcoin, we had HashCash and bit gold and DigiCash. They were wrong, but they were wrong in the right direction, so you just had to pull them along enough and then eventually it fell through. So you have things like BATs, and I mentioned that before, and suddenly now you've created demand for a token. Steem had enormous growth, but the problem was there was no demand for the token, but there was good payment for content creation and curation. So they got a lot of users, but they had too much value leakage, so they couldn't sustain network value and then the system fell apart.\n\nI almost felt if you could combine BATs and Steem together, then you've created a feedback loop where the system will sustain and it'll continue to grow at a very rapid rate. However, they had to use the token to subsidize the actual running of the infrastructure. They didn't have a sustainable model there. So even though it was the protocol Steem and Steemit was just the company, the Steemit company had all the power and control because they were the people that could afford to run that protocol.\n\n**BG:** We've got a hive now, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source code and decentralized communities.\n\n**CH:** It's a Pareto problem where a small group runs the vast majority of everything and there's no economic diversity there. With Cardano, we spent five years on Ouroboros because we wanted a system that would get naturally more decentralized over time. So as the price of ADA increases, the K factor increases, and then suddenly you go from 1,000 to 10,000 stake pools and then 100,000, and then all the infrastructure is federated with those stake pools, so suddenly you have 10,000 Hydra channels and suddenly you have 10,000 oracle entry points et cetera, et cetera. So the system, when we get to Bitcoin scale, could have 100,000 stake pool operators that run that, and that scales quite nicely.\n\n**BG:** I'm sort of thinking into the growth of SingularityNET during the next phase. I think that the platform as we've built it now does something good. If you create multiple AI agents all over the place that collaborate and cooperate to solve hard problems. But we need to architect the next stages of development in a way that will incentivize massive increase of utilization of the platform using AGI ADA, but also that will ensure that increasing decentralized control of the network happens along with this massive increasing utilization. I think we can do it, and I think a lot of the thinking you guys have put into growing Cardano was actually helpful there in ways that we probably don't have time to explore in this podcast.\n\n**CH:** Well you get the democracy stack for free with Catalyst, and you also get the decentralized infrastructure for free. One thing we'd love to do is see if we can get outsourceable computation. I've been following that for God knows how many years. Pinocchio and Geppetto over at MSR, can you do the computation on an untrusted computer, but then provide a proof that the computation was done correctly? And then you know that whatever the result was given is right, regardless of who did it.\n\n**BG:** That's there on the computer science level, but it's not yet there on the scalable, usable software level.\n\n**CH:** We have some proof that perhaps these algorithms work, but a lot of them are exponential time.\n\n**BG:** One of the things I've been doing with my non-existent spare time is going through all the core cognitive algorithms of OpenCog, which is the AI architecture I'm working on, expressing all the core algorithms of OpenCog in terms of Galois connections over metagraphs and the chrono morphisms and stuff. So you get the right elegant formalization of your core cognitive algorithms. And then once you've done that, then you can deploy the kind of math you're saying so that this core AGI computation could be done by outsourced computing. So the math and CS is there for a lot of these different things, but there's a number of stages yet to go through before that kind of thing is rolled out scalably.\n\n**CH:** That's an interesting mathematical expression. Do you deal with a dependent type system?\n\n**BG:** It's an independent pair of consistent probabilistic type systems, so yeah.\n\n**CH:** That's a mouthful. But can you prove anything interesting? You can show certain things that are isomorphic to each other or what you are looking for with those.\n\n**BG:** We are working on that right now, actually. But this would probably lead us too deep down some usually interesting rabbit holes for a broad audience podcast.\n\n**CH:** Okay, fair enough. All right. Well, Ben, this has been so much fun. I have another meeting I got to jump into, but I really enjoyed our time.\n\n**BG:** Yeah, this is fantastic. It's both broad and deep, and I think decentralized social networks, it's both really important on its own, and I think we can work together to solve it, but it also highlights a bunch of other more general points, both about bringing Singularity and Cardano together and about just what we need blockchain and AI together to do. So yeah, very cool. Look forward to the next one.\n\n**CH:** I guess a closing point is platforms tend to get defined by the killer apps that are on the platforms, and I'm very glad that one of the most meaningful and significant applications on our platform is SingularityNET. I would hate to see us be defined by Crypto Kitties or something like that. It's great to have you guys around. I think this collaboration is going to result in an enormous amount of evolution of our own platform and an acid testing of things in a way that's very productive for everybody. And my hope is you guys become one of the most successful pieces of infrastructure on top of a Cardano and it leads to a lot of user growth. And we're not just collaborating technologically. I think we're going to share some office space at some point in Ethiopia.\n\n**BG:** The space has been found, actually. So our Addis team and your Addis team will co-locate.\n\n**CH:** John was very excited about it, so I imagine the office is quite nice.\n\n**BG:** It's in Bole, which is a great neighborhood. It was a very pleasant and surprising coincidence that we actually both had flourishing teams in Addis Ababa contributing to the development of our various platforms. Very cool that maybe the next time we meet face to face will be over some injera in Addis.\n\n**CH:** That'd be a lot of fun. That'd be a lot of it just to have to get rid of the civil war and the COVID, but those are just minor technical details,\u00a0 All right. Thank you so much, Ben.\n\n**BG:** Great. Thanks a lot.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "decentralizing-social-media", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/02/05/decentralizing-social-media/", "read_time": 57}, {"publish_date": "2021-01-06T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/344fa779-3928-4439-870f-7977abbfec51/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": " Project Catalyst blasts off into 2021 ", "subtitle": "New fund will commit $500k in ada to find groundbreaking ideas which accelerate Cardano development", "audio": "", "soundcloud": [{"trackid": 987296944}], "body_content": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\nProject Catalyst is the first stage in our Voltaire roadmap, created to bring best-in-class governance to Cardano.

But it\u2019s not one that we can accomplish alone. That\u2019s why we are always on the lookout for relationships which help us build a global foundation for growth. So, we\u2019re thrilled to announce our hackathon challenge to support the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals (SDGs) designed to accelerate progress on fighting hunger, injustice, and climate change.\n\n## Sustainability and blockchain\n\nIn this hackathon challenge we aim to give the blockchain community an opportunity to make an impact on international development. The challenge will draw on IOHK\u2019s expertise in community-focused funding developed with Project Catalyst. This initiative brings innovation, voting, and decentralized funding to Cardano by crowdsourcing development proposals, and financing their implementation.\n\nIOHK and United Nations personnel will use the Project Catalyst platform to find and fund initiatives that align with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. These goals were adopted by 193 world leaders in 2015. Each of the 17 targets focus on ending extreme poverty and hunger, fighting inequality and injustice, and tackling climate change by 2030.\n\nThis IOHK-sponsored challenge hopes to promote projects based in the digitization of finance which increase the efficacy and transparency of funding for the UN\u2019s Decade of Action. In the run-up to the 2030 deadline for achieving the global sustainability goals, the UN is marking 75 years since its establishment. Given that the transnational organization works on global collective action problems it has engaged with blockchain technology as a solution.\n\n## Crowdsourcing the future\n\nParticipants in the program can put forward ideas focused on any of the 17 goals. To encourage participation, IOHK is sponsoring a prize fund of ada worth $10,000 as well as ongoing support to bring the projects to fruition. Proposals will be judged by a panel of IOHK and UN employees. They will determine the winners based on an idea\u2019s technical prowess, scalability and social impact, as well as its financial and volunteer support. The winning ideas will be able to seek the advice of experts from both the UN and IOHK to ensure that they are implemented in the most impactful way.\n\nTo qualify for the scheme, entries must be open source and be created for use on the Cardano blockchain. Example code should be written in Marlowe, a domain specific language developed for financial contracts on Cardano. These do not need to be fully coded submissions. Instead they can be ideas which inspire anyone to get involved with blockchain technology and sustainable development. The proposal submission period opens on Saturday October 10th. Participants must be registered by then in order to submit. Entries must be finalized by October 18 at 11:59 MDT.

But it\u2019s not one that we can accomplish alone. That\u2019s why we are always on the lookout for relationships which help us build a global foundation for growth. So, we\u2019re thrilled to announce our hackathon challenge to support the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals (SDGs) designed to accelerate progress on fighting hunger, injustice, and climate change.\n\n## Sustainability and blockchain\n\nIn this hackathon challenge we aim to give the blockchain community an opportunity to make an impact on international development. The challenge will draw on IOHK\u2019s expertise in community-focused funding developed with Project Catalyst. This initiative brings innovation, voting, and decentralized funding to Cardano by crowdsourcing development proposals, and financing their implementation.\n\nIOHK and United Nations personnel will use the Project Catalyst platform to find and fund initiatives that align with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. These goals were adopted by 193 world leaders in 2015. Each of the 17 targets focus on ending extreme poverty and hunger, fighting inequality and injustice, and tackling climate change by 2030.\n\nThis IOHK-sponsored challenge hopes to promote projects based in the digitization of finance which increase the efficacy and transparency of funding for the UN\u2019s Decade of Action. In the run-up to the 2030 deadline for achieving the global sustainability goals, the UN is marking 75 years since its establishment. Given that the transnational organization works on global collective action problems it has engaged with blockchain technology as a solution.\n\n## Crowdsourcing the future\n\nParticipants in the program can put forward ideas focused on any of the 17 goals. To encourage participation, IOHK is sponsoring a prize fund of ada worth $10,000 as well as ongoing support to bring the projects to fruition. Proposals will be judged by a panel of IOHK and UN employees. They will determine the winners based on an idea\u2019s technical prowess, scalability and social impact, as well as its financial and volunteer support. The winning ideas will be able to seek the advice of experts from both the UN and IOHK to ensure that they are implemented in the most impactful way.\n\nTo qualify for the scheme, entries must be open source and be created for use on the Cardano blockchain. Example code should be written in Marlowe, a domain specific language developed for financial contracts on Cardano. These do not need to be fully coded submissions. Instead they can be ideas which inspire anyone to get involved with blockchain technology and sustainable development. The proposal submission period opens on Saturday October 10th. Participants must be registered by then in order to submit. Entries must be finalized by October 18 at 11:59 MDT.

Whatever the pace and cadence of future rollouts, we wanted to develop a consistent method by which all updates to the core node could be easily adopted by everyone.\n\nIn order to make that integration and interaction with Cardano easier and faster, IOHK engineers formed the Adrestia team, to take responsibility for building all the web APIs and libraries that make Cardano accessible to developers and application builders.

Exchanges or third-party wallets using Cardano-SL, should now be integrating to prepare for the new Byron and upgrading to Shelley wallet. These need to happen consecutively to avoid any outages.

Long time supporters of IOHK are likely familiar with his signature long hair, beard, and penchant for drinking tea while discussing decentralization in front of a [white board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZGVgNsJSnA&t=572s). He recently sat down for an interview to discuss the upcoming Byron reboot, the Haskell Shelley testnet, and the conclusion of the pre-Shelley development cycle. Coutts, who has been working with IOHK since 2016, brings a wealth of knowledge from working with the Haskell programming language for nearly 20 years and helping found the Well-Typed consultancy.\n\n**What\u2019s your role at IOHK?**\n\nI\u2019m the chief technical architect for the Cardano project and I\u2019m primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the node. This means that I collaborate with the teams that work on consensus, ledger, networking, and other things. Ultimately, I work to bring everyone together around the same design after a discussion with the team leaders. The design of Cardano is the product of joint work by many individuals working together.\n\n**What does the Haskell programming language bring to Cardano?**\n\nHaskell is an enabler. It makes it easier for us to follow the approach that we believe is right, which is driven by computer science. We know how to do things properly; computer science tells us how. We just need to pick the appropriate techniques to do that. Haskell makes that easier.\n\nIt\u2019s a good fit for Cardano because it suits the high-assurance, specification-driven software that is vital for a blockchain. Haskell helps us find systematic ways of avoiding mistakes. In essence, it\u2019s a better mousetrap.\n\n**You\u2019ve been working with Haskell for a long time. How have you seen the landscape of functional programming change?**\n\nPeople take it seriously now. When I started as an undergraduate in 1999, I thought that Haskell was amazing. Other students thought, \u2018Wow that\u2019s totally impractical. How will you ever get a job?\u2019\n\nAt the time, functional programming was an academic curiosity. There wasn\u2019t any prebuilt code and it wasn\u2019t machine readable, which meant that Haskell wasn\u2019t usable for a wide range of people. There wasn\u2019t the tooling, range of libraries, or experience. That has changed over the years: the tooling got better, the libraries got better. IOHK has helped develop the infrastructure for building and distributing open-source Haskell code and the number of libraries exploded. That, combined with more teaching and a gradual change of attitude in the industry, means that people take it more seriously now. Haskell hasn\u2019t changed as much as the industry around us has.\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest change from an industry point of view?**\n\nThere are two things. The first is that attitudes are changing, albeit slowly. People are changing their opinions about what they consider a sensible language choice. Previously, everything had to be in C or Java or maybe Python, but eventually good ideas make progress, even if it takes a long time. You can make a lot of progress by just recognizing that a good idea is a good idea. The mainstream does pick up on important developments, even if it does take 10 or 15 years. The industry has not embraced functional programming wholesale yet, but individual programmers have taken up various ideas. That makes Haskell look less radical.\n\nIf you look at a language like Rust, it has some of the clever type systems of Haskell, although it doesn\u2019t have any functional programming ideas. Even Java and C++ have some functional programming ideas in them these days, so Haskell is not quite so far from the mainstream as it used to be.\n\nThe second major change has been performance, which is getting much better. We\u2019ve recently become competitive with Java in terms of performance. It makes people say, \u2018Wow, Haskell is so fast,\u2019 but that\u2019s because they\u2019re comparing it to Python and PHP rather than C. So that\u2019s another way of saying that Haskell has improved slightly, but the industry environment around it has changed as well.\n\n**You have been heavily involved in the Byron reboot which was kicked off last week. Why was this work important?**\n\nThe [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/) is the culmination of over 18 months of hard work across multiple IOHK development teams, and constitutes a complete overhaul of the node infrastructure with 100% fresh code. The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself.

Long time supporters of IOHK are likely familiar with his signature long hair, beard, and penchant for drinking tea while discussing decentralization in front of a [white board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZGVgNsJSnA&t=572s). He recently sat down for an interview to discuss the upcoming Byron reboot, the Haskell Shelley testnet, and the conclusion of the pre-Shelley development cycle. Coutts, who has been working with IOHK since 2016, brings a wealth of knowledge from working with the Haskell programming language for nearly 20 years and helping found the Well-Typed consultancy.\n\n**What\u2019s your role at IOHK?**\n\nI\u2019m the chief technical architect for the Cardano project and I\u2019m primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the node. This means that I collaborate with the teams that work on consensus, ledger, networking, and other things. Ultimately, I work to bring everyone together around the same design after a discussion with the team leaders. The design of Cardano is the product of joint work by many individuals working together.\n\n**What does the Haskell programming language bring to Cardano?**\n\nHaskell is an enabler. It makes it easier for us to follow the approach that we believe is right, which is driven by computer science. We know how to do things properly; computer science tells us how. We just need to pick the appropriate techniques to do that. Haskell makes that easier.\n\nIt\u2019s a good fit for Cardano because it suits the high-assurance, specification-driven software that is vital for a blockchain. Haskell helps us find systematic ways of avoiding mistakes. In essence, it\u2019s a better mousetrap.\n\n**You\u2019ve been working with Haskell for a long time. How have you seen the landscape of functional programming change?**\n\nPeople take it seriously now. When I started as an undergraduate in 1999, I thought that Haskell was amazing. Other students thought, \u2018Wow that\u2019s totally impractical. How will you ever get a job?\u2019\n\nAt the time, functional programming was an academic curiosity. There wasn\u2019t any prebuilt code and it wasn\u2019t machine readable, which meant that Haskell wasn\u2019t usable for a wide range of people. There wasn\u2019t the tooling, range of libraries, or experience. That has changed over the years: the tooling got better, the libraries got better. IOHK has helped develop the infrastructure for building and distributing open-source Haskell code and the number of libraries exploded. That, combined with more teaching and a gradual change of attitude in the industry, means that people take it more seriously now. Haskell hasn\u2019t changed as much as the industry around us has.\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest change from an industry point of view?**\n\nThere are two things. The first is that attitudes are changing, albeit slowly. People are changing their opinions about what they consider a sensible language choice. Previously, everything had to be in C or Java or maybe Python, but eventually good ideas make progress, even if it takes a long time. You can make a lot of progress by just recognizing that a good idea is a good idea. The mainstream does pick up on important developments, even if it does take 10 or 15 years. The industry has not embraced functional programming wholesale yet, but individual programmers have taken up various ideas. That makes Haskell look less radical.\n\nIf you look at a language like Rust, it has some of the clever type systems of Haskell, although it doesn\u2019t have any functional programming ideas. Even Java and C++ have some functional programming ideas in them these days, so Haskell is not quite so far from the mainstream as it used to be.\n\nThe second major change has been performance, which is getting much better. We\u2019ve recently become competitive with Java in terms of performance. It makes people say, \u2018Wow, Haskell is so fast,\u2019 but that\u2019s because they\u2019re comparing it to Python and PHP rather than C. So that\u2019s another way of saying that Haskell has improved slightly, but the industry environment around it has changed as well.\n\n**You have been heavily involved in the Byron reboot which was kicked off last week. Why was this work important?**\n\nThe [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/) is the culmination of over 18 months of hard work across multiple IOHK development teams, and constitutes a complete overhaul of the node infrastructure with 100% fresh code. The reboot introduces an extensible, modular design within the node itself, separating out the ledger, consensus, and networking components, as well as improvements and new functionality in the wallet backend and the Cardano explorer.\n\nFor Daedalus users, the Byron reboot will see us moving to a regular update cadence [see our recent piece on [Daedalus Flight](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/01/we-need-you-for-the-daedalus-flight-testing-program/) for more on that], after which they should find that Daedalus is faster, more reliable, and uses less memory. A lot of the issues users have experienced with Daedalus in the past were due to the underlying node, rather than Daedalus itself. The Byron reboot will go a long way to improving things, and users should see Daedalus syncing and restoring wallets within minutes, even when downloading the entire Cardano blockchain.\n\n**As the chief architect, your job is to lay the foundation for Cardano\u2019s future.

Plutus is no different. Compared to their object-oriented counterparts, functional programming languages are less prone to ambiguity and human error \u2013 always a good thing \u2013 as well as being easier to verify and test. By using Plutus to write smart contracts on the Cardano network, developers benefit from all of the above, as well as the ability to use the same language for both on and off-chain code.\n\nWhile developers will have to wait for the Goguen era to launch smart contracts on the Cardano network, they can begin testing their smart contract skills in the [Plutus Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/plutus/tools/playground/ \"Plutus Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"). IOHK has also created a [Plutus ebook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plutus-Writing-reliable-smart-contracts-ebook/dp/B07V46LWTW \"Plutus ebook, amazon.com\") and [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/plutus-reliable-smart-contracts/ \"Plutus Udemy course, udemy.com\") to help developers hit the ground running once Plutus is available on the Cardano mainnet.\n\n## And bringing Plutus to everyone with Marlowe\n\nThe problem with smart contracts, however, is that sometimes the people who know how to write the code don\u2019t have the industry expertise to know how to structure the contracts themselves. Enter Marlowe, IOHK\u2019s domain-specific language (DSL). Marlowe is designed for use by anyone that wants to write a financial smart contract without the programming skills to implement it. Users can try out Marlowe via the [Marlowe Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/marlowe/get-started/sample-marlowe-smart-contracts/ \"Marlowe Playground, testnet.iohkdev.io\"), a web utility with a user-friendly GUI and drag and drop components, where they can create financial smart contracts which, when complete, will generate fully-functional, implementation-ready Plutus code.\n\nMarlowe gives anyone the ability to gain familiarity with smart contracts while protecting them from unexpected outcomes. It also protects the developer and the system by ensuring that ill-formed smart contracts cannot be run. Finally, Marlowe focuses on commitment-of-funds and time-outs. These make certain that both parties have dedicated funds in the agreement while ensuring that money will not be left in the system after a contract has concluded.\n\n## Laying solid foundations\n\nPlutus, Marlowe, and the Cardano ecosystem continue to evolve to provide the safest and most efficient conditions to build decentralized applications. The next generations of Plutus and Marlowe will be announced at the WyoHackathon at the University of Wyoming on September 20, ahead of their release on mainnet at the start of the Goguen era. Marlowe advances include a high-fidelity development system that aids the writing of executable contracts and the new iteration of Plutus will allow users to access their contracts from web or mobile applications.

Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the

Cardano and the Nervos Network. Once completed, this pioneering cross-chain bridge will enable users to transact assets between the two blockchains. The end goal is to foster greater interoperability while expanding the global reach and utility of both Nervos and Cardano.\n\n\n\nThe Nervos \u2018Common Knowledge Base\u2019 ([CKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nervos-network/historical-data/)) is a permissionless, layer 1, open-source, proof-of-work blockchain protocol focused on creating the foundations for an interoperable universal public network. It allows any crypto asset to be kept in a secure, immutable, and permissionless environment with the added benefit of smart contracts and layer 2 scaling.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNervos is developing this robust network through three key components. Together, these make up the Universal Passport, Nervos\u2019 approach to next generation interoperability.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* **PW Core** \u2013 enables developers to build applications on all chains\n* **Nervos\u2019 Polyjuice** \u2013 an Ethereum-compatible layer that allows developers to port a smart contract from Ethereum to Nervos\n* **Force Bridge** \u2013 a trustless bridge that enables cross-chain transactions between Nervos and a spectrum of blockchains. Nervos will use Force Bridge to connect directly to Cardano, which means that users will be able to transact using their existing Cardano wallets.\n\n\n\n## Bridging blockchains with transportable tokens\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Holders of Nervos CKByte (CKB) and ada will be able to transact both currencies interchangeably. Nervos users will also be able to take advantage of Cardano's native asset standard to create tokens that can be ported and used across both networks. On top of this, the bridge enables developers on both chains gain access to services and features to expand their DApp ecosystem and user bases.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Mousebelt](https://www.mousebelt.com/), a full-service blockchain accelerator, will build the bridge with financial support from Nervos. The Cardano team will contribute expertise and resources to connect Cardano to the bridge. Development work is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the next six weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\n'Using the Force Bridge to link the Nervos Network and Cardano is especially exciting given the relationship we have already built with IOHK,' said Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos. 'We have been growing our research and development partnership, but we will soon have a tangible bridge that will also showcase the power of the Force Bridge and push us further along the road to a functional and interoperable network.'\n\n\n\nThis bridge is just part of our collaboration with Nervos. 'We share a vision of a world that works on a \u2018constellation\u2019 of interoperating blockchains,' says Romain Pellerin, CTO at Input Output. 'We believe that academic research is also fundamental to advancing the entire crypto space. Together we will also be co-authoring academic papers to pioneer improvements to the UTXO model, explore universal accounting standards, and contribute to the future development of decentralized technology through open-source research.'\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology will only achieve mainstream acceptance when end users are not locked into one blockchain or standard, but can seamlessly access value and utility, regardless of which blockchain they are using. 'Bridges like this are an absolute necessity in order to ensure that users have a seamless experience,' continued Pellerin. \u2018By connecting our communities and finding innovative new ways to work together, as we have been doing with Nervos, we can ensure that blockchain lives up to its promises of creating a fairer and more efficient global financial operating system.'\n\n\n\n*Check out the [Nervos website](https://www.nervos.org/) for more information on upcoming partnerships and research initiatives.*\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/06/02/nervos-partnership-to-build-the-first-cross-chain-bridge-with-cardano/", "read_time": 3}, {"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": {"title": "Shruti Appiah", "display_name": "", "thumbnail": "https://ucarecdn.com/4df5ffe0-0a4a-4003-89e2-eb9a499b5155/", "is_team_member": true, "is_active": true, "localized": [{"job_titles": [{"name": "Product Manager", "primary": true}, {"name": "Engineering", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrutiappiah/", "twitter": "", "github": "https://github.com/ShrutiAppiah"}}], "job_titles": [{"name": "Product Manager", "primary": true}, {"name": "Engineering", "primary": null}], "lang": "en", "profile_links": {"email": "", "youtube": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrutiappiah/", "twitter": "", "github": "https://github.com/ShrutiAppiah"}, "profile_url": "/blog/authors/shruti-appiah/", "blog_posts": [{"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/84e114f9-431a-4539-8ede-c18b883446d7/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe

Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users.

Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe (starting June 3rd), you can [register on our website](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/) for these webinars now!*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/", "read_time": 6}, {"publish_date": "2021-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": null, "video_id": null, "main_image": "https://ucarecdn.com/84e114f9-431a-4539-8ede-c18b883446d7/", "custom_meta_img": null, "old_url": null, "haskell": null, "localized": [{"lang": "en", "title": "Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

"Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe

*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": []}], "lang": "en", "title": "Reimagining peer to peer finance with Marlowe", "subtitle": "Marlowe decentralizes financial tools allowing anyone to create and execute peer-to-peer financial agreements", "audio": null, "soundcloud": [], "body_content": "A while ago, I logged in to my stock trading platform to buy some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Alas, the platform was down! It turned out that the surge in the GameStop stock had forced quite a few trading platforms to shut down temporarily.  We weren\u2019t in the middle of a financial crisis, and I never expected that my bank or brokerage would block me from using my own funds without warning. I had assumed that I would always be able to access my funds, place trades, and reap profits or losses \u2013 a service for which I pay a handsome fee. \r\n\r\nIn the following days, several other stock brokers and trading platforms began blocking their users from performing trades that didn\u2019t favour the brokers\u2019 own agenda. Robinhood \u2013 which positions itself as the platform that *democratizes* finance \u2013 completely censored its users from buying GameStop stock. Are we ever truly in control of our money?\r\n\r\nAlmost all of us have given custody of our funds to some third-party, leaving us at their discretion to decide if and when those funds can be accessed, used, or even viewed. The commonality between these third-party banks and brokers is that there is a central point of control. In the case of Robinhood and GameStop, we have seen how this centralization can lead to failure. The central point of control can be influenced, attacked, or manipulated by an external self-interested actor, making it the antithesis of *democratized* finance.\r\n\r\nThis is the core motivator of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi. DeFi offers a similar set of financial tools offered by Wall Street such as lending, escrows, derivatives, swaps, and securities. What makes DeFi platforms stand out is their ability to offer these financial instruments without the need for central market makers, banks, or brokers. Each financial agreement is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, and is settled algorithmically. Their decentralized nature makes them far more resilient to market manipulation or the failure of a centralized system. \r\n\r\nWe are currently developing a suite of Marlowe products to democratize finance and enable easy access to financial agreements. This includes **Marlowe Run**, a new product that will allow users to seamlessly execute off-the-shelf financial agreements with friends or clients in a secure fashion, and on their own. With added automation features and no need for third-parties, this peer-to-peer solution will be cost-effective, and more importantly, *democratizing*.\r\n\r\n## What is the Marlowe suite?\r\n\r\nWith Marlowe, we aim to democratize finance by facilitating peer-to-peer agreements that run on a blockchain. We seek to empower people to create their own financial instruments and set up agreements with anyone with whom they want to interact. Marlowe will offer a suite of products, each product serving a different function and set of users. Marlowe\u2019s overarching product strategy comprises three streams \u2013 *Marlowe for developers*, *Marlowe for end users*, and *Marlowe for enterprise*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A46Yrdg7Q5fvq6sZFrNZkA-OwipwfVz13DEkbpe46T2kyTNQyPztJ28ZKQJv1olh0yRoQIgoS5C6nIO9iAHorQRLoC4UxBKM3ABFPdzvvJiWa2O6SR1YjYENcoOVXjUvoRTL4lI)\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for developers\r\n\r\nMarlowe for developers includes **Marlowe Build** and **Marlowe Play** (also called the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/)) as well as the input to the **Marlowe Library**. Marlowe Build and Marlowe Play together enable end-to-end financial smart contract development.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDevelopers can compose smart contract code on *Marlowe Build*. Then, they can perform preliminary iterative design using simulations, and formally verify and test smart contracts on *Marlowe Play*. These capabilities \u2013 paired with a purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL) for finance \u2013 ensure that the contracts are easy and straightforward to build, as well as being secure, verifiable, and rigorously tested. Once built and tested, developers may contribute them to our open-source smart contract template library, the *Marlowe Library*.\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Marlowe for end users\r\n\r\nMarlowe for end users will bring an intuitive, straightforward, and seamless interface for users to execute financial agreements with their friends, colleagues, or clients on the blockchain. This includes **Marlowe Run** and gives access to a variety of templates for financial instruments from the Marlowe Library. We\u2019re designing these products with the user in mind. To make financial agreements on the Marlowe Run, the user does not need to know the ins and outs of blockchain, or how to write smart contracts. Every step of the contract is explained in non-technical language, and each action is performed only with the user\u2019s explicit authorization. Our team has built a suite of rigorously tested and verified financial tools including escrows, debt securities, and swaps that can be used on the Marlowe Run. These \u2013 and many more verified open-source contracts \u2013 are made available through the Marlowe Library. \r\n\r\n## Marlowe for enterprise ##\r\nMarlowe for enterprise aims to expand DeFi beyond individual users, helping enterprises to access the tangible benefits of smart contracts. This will include a bespoke, customizable suite of capabilities and financial agreements that are tailored to a commercial use case, with the provision of smart contract templates that adopt Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards [(Actus)](https://www.actusfrf.org/) for financial contracts.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Marlowe on Cardano ##\r\nIn 2020, we rolled out the [Marlowe Playground Alpha](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/). This provided the ability to write contracts in JavaScript, in addition to Haskell, or directly in Marlowe itself. This also included proof-of-concept oracles, with the ability to access external data such as price, directly from a stock market \u2018ticker\u2019 or, in the future, data feeds such as Coinbase. To support the rollout, we published tutorials to guide developers. We have since been building on this work, continuing to improve the user experience, and building, testing, and validating more smart contract templates.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Goguen rollout, we are now in the process of completing the implementation of Marlowe on Cardano, giving users and organizations the opportunity to execute DeFi contracts they have written themselves or downloaded from a contract repository. Marlowe will run first of all on the Cardano blockchain, but it is blockchain-agnostic so could run on other blockchains to reach an even broader audience in the future.\r\n\r\n## What comes next? ##\r\nMarlowe for end users will come online in stages throughout 2021. First, is the prototype of Marlowe Run, where users can demo and try out their own financial agreements. This will include a suite of financial smart contract templates that users can customize to their needs. This prototype will allow users to explore the experience of making financial agreements in a decentralized fashion, all in a peer-to-peer manner without requiring a value-extracting third party. To use the Marlowe Run prototype, users don\u2019t need to own any real tokens, so they may try the demo before they onboard. This rollout will include a suite of template financial instruments, built by our in-house developers. These templates can be used to execute test agreements on Marlowe Run. We\u2019ll share a demo of Marlowe Run on this month\u2019s Cardano360 show (airs May 27) so join us for that.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to delivering this suite of products for the Marlowe ecosystem that empower people across the globe to build, control, and execute their own financial instruments on their terms. \r\n\r\n*We are planning a series of webinars on decentralized finance with Marlowe (starting June 3rd), you can [register on our website](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/) for these webinars now!*", "uses_mathjax": false, "attachments": [], "slug": "reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe", "url": "/blog/posts/2021/05/26/reimagining-peer-to-peer-finance-with-marlowe/", "read_time": 6}], "total_pages": 44, "current_page": 1, "filters": {"2016": {"10": 4, "12": 1, "__total": 23, "09": 5, "08": 3, "07": 5, "05": 2, "01": 3}, "2017": {"10": 7, "11": 2, "12": 5, "__total": 43, "09": 3, "08": 4, "07": 3, "06": 2, "05": 2, "04": 2, "03": 6, "02": 6, "01": 1}, "2018": {"10": 4, "12": 5, "__total": 37, "09": 1, "08": 3, "07": 3, "06": 3, "05": 4, "04": 3, "03": 3, "02": 4, "01": 4}, "2019": {"10": 1, "11": 1, "12": 1, "__total": 24, "09": 4, "07": 4, "06": 2, "05": 2, "04": 4, "03": 1, "02": 2, "01": 2}, "2020": {"10": 6, "11": 7, "12": 11, "__total": 56, "09": 3, "08": 2, "07": 4, "06": 6, "05": 5, "04": 4, "03": 3, "02": 4, "01": 1}, "2021": {"__total": 35, "06": 2, "05": 6, "04": 8, "03": 7, "02": 7, "01": 5}}, "crumbs": [{"path": "/blog/posts/page-1/", "name": "blog_posts", "active": true}]}}}
